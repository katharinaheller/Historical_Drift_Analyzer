# Historical Drift Analyzer (HDA)

A modular Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for analyzing **semantic drift over time** in scientific literature.  
The system combines **temporal-aware retrieval**, **intent-specific reranking**, and **reproducible evaluation** to study how conceptual meanings evolve across decades.

---

## Research Objective

The project investigates how historically informed retrieval and reranking strategies affect:

- semantic relevance of retrieved evidence,
- temporal coverage for diachronic analysis,
- faithfulness of generated answers to cited sources.

The core research question is how a **modular RAG architecture** can be designed to support **reproducible, methodologically transparent analysis of semantic change** in scientific corpora.

---

## System Architecture

The pipeline separates **offline corpus processing** (ingestion, embedding, indexing) from **online query processing** (retrieval, reranking, generation).

**Key components:**
- PDF ingestion and metadata extraction (publication year as temporal anchor)
- Text chunking with configurable overlap
- Dense embeddings + FAISS vector store
- Intent classification (conceptual vs. chronological queries)
- Intent-specific reranking:
  - Semantic reranker for conceptual coherence
  - Temporal reranker for diachronic coverage
- LLM-based answer synthesis with explicit source citations

---

## Evaluation Methodology

The evaluation follows a two-level framework:

1) **Intrinsic Retrieval Quality**  
   - Metric: NDCG@k  
   - Ground truth derived from embedding-based semantic ordering  
   - Evaluated for multiple top-k configurations

2) **Extrinsic Answer Faithfulness**  
   - Claim-based faithfulness metric  
   - Measures how strongly generated statements are supported by retrieved evidence

### NDCG Distribution

### Faithfulness Comparison Across Models

The results demonstrate stable retrieval relevance and consistent faithfulness behavior across different top-k settings and model backends.

## Reproducibility

All pipeline stages are deterministic and configurable.

```bash
# create environment
poetry install

# build embeddings and FAISS index
python scripts/build_index.py

# run evaluation
python scripts/run_evaluation.py

All intermediate artifacts (retrieved chunks, reranking scores, evaluation logs) are persisted to enable full auditability of experimental results.

Status

This repository reflects the final evaluated research prototype used in the concept study and evaluation report.
The architecture is intentionally modular to support future extensions (e.g., alternative retrievers, GraphRAG-style components, additional rerankers).
