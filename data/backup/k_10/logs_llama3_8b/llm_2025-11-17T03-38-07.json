Provide a precise definition, clarify theoretical foundations, and explain how interpretations evolved across time and publications. Use event years ONLY if explicitly stated in the snippets. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nDefine explain the role of knowledge engineering in early ai systems., describe its theoretical foundations, and explain how definitions evolved historically across publications.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] Expert_Systems.pdf (2016)\n.

  "model_output": "**Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Engineering**\n\nKnowledge engineering played a significant role in early AI systems, serving as a bridge between human expertise and machine intelligence. The concept emerged in the 1970s as part of the broader AI field ([1], 2016). Expert systems, one of the earliest research areas in AI, were knowledge-intensive software designed to solve specific domain problems using the expertise of a human professional ([1], 2016). The theoretical foundations of knowledge engineering revolve around eliciting, organizing, and representing specialized knowledge from human experts and integrating it into expert systems for automated reasoning ([1], 2016). These systems are composed of two main components: a knowledge base and an inference engine. The knowledge base contains IF-THEN rules and factual information, while the inference engine determines how the system reasons using forward and backward chaining ([1], 2016). The evolution of definitions for knowledge engineering across publications can be observed in their application fields and technological advancements. Initially, expert systems were primarily applied in domains such as engineering, chemistry, medicine, and industry during the early 1980s ([1], 2016). Over time, with advancements in AI, large language models (LLMs) have emerged, which have revolutionized the way we develop and use AI algorithms. Recent examples include ChatGPT, a powerful AI chatbot based on LLMs that has attracted widespread attention ([5], 2025). **References**\n[1] Expert_Systems.pdf (2016)\n[2] 1304.1106v1.pdf (1990)\n[3] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n[4] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\n[5] 2303.18223v16.pdf (2025)"
