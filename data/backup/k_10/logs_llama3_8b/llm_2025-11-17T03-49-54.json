  "model_output": "Artificial Intelligence systems, particularly rule-based ones, manage uncertainty by employing various models and algorithms to quantify and propagate uncertainty within a system [1]. The theoretical foundations of this approach are based on maximin summarizing, multiplication scaling, and Beckerman's modified certainty factor model for combining evidence across rules [1]. In the 1980s, research focused on psychologically realistic ways of modeling propagation of uncertainty in rule-based reasoning [1]. These models aimed to improve the simulation accuracy of human cognition by implementing solutions to two sub-problems: summarizing uncertain data and scaling down certainty factors for conclusions based on the antecedent evidence within a single production rule [1]. However, it was acknowledged that both probabilistic and decision theoretic schemes as well as rule-based alternatives may not perfectly represent human reasoning under uncertainty [3]. An alternative approach to purely rule-based systems emerged with the use of statistical models, such as Hidden Markov Models (HMM), to generate rules for components of a Natural Language Generation (NLG) system [2]. The evolution of rule-based systems for managing uncertainty across publications shows that early research focused on implementing psychologically valid solutions for handling uncertainty within rule-based reasoning [1]. In the 1990s, there was an increased emphasis on Bayesian networks and comparisons between Bayes nets and rule bases to address system behavior and sensitivity analysis [4]. More recently, NLG systems have incorporated both neural and non-neural models, with statistical approaches aiming to be more adaptable to different domains than strictly rule-based systems [2].
