Provide a precise definition, clarify theoretical foundations, and explain how interpretations evolved across time and publications. Use event years ONLY if explicitly stated in the snippets. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3.

  "model_output": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Symbolic Processing Theory (SP Theory)\n\nThe SP theory, proposed in 2018 [1], is a comprehensive computing and cognitive theory aiming to integrate and simplify concepts within these fields, with a particular focus on AI. The SP theory provides an attractive model for database applications due to its simplicity and versatility in representing knowledge ([1], 2018). The SP theory encompasses various AI functions such as probabilistic and exact forms of reasoning, unsupervised learning, fuzzy pattern recognition, best-match information retrieval, planning, problem solving, and natural language analysis and production ([1], 2018). The SP theory is conceived as a system for unsupervised learning, with capabilities demonstrated in the SP70 computer model ([1], 2003c, 2002b). The development of the SP system was inspired by the writings of Allen Newell, emphasizing greater breadth and depth in theories of cognition ([1], 2018). The theory offers a framework for processing knowledge that integrates and simplifies AI functions. Prototypes of the SP system have been developed as software simulations running on an ordinary computer, demonstrating its potential applications ([1], 2018). The SP system supports probabilistic deduction, abductive reasoning, and nonmonotonic reasoning with default values ([1], 1999b). It has been applied successfully to route finding problems and geometric analogy problems translated into textual form ([1], 2003b, 1999b). The SP system should also be able to organize its knowledge automatically, minimizing redundancies and revealing the natural structures in that knowledge ([1], 2018). The evolution of the SP theory across publications is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the SP theory has undergone development since at least 2000 when the first computer model, SP61, was created ([1], 2000). References:\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)"
