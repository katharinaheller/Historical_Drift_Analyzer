  "model_output": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field that focuses on creating machine-based intelligence, as opposed to human or animal intelligence [1, 2024]. The definition and evolution of AI have been primarily centered around the Turing Test, proposed in the 1950s [3, 2025], which evaluates a machine's ability to mimic human-like conversation. According to the sources, authentic intelligence, as defined by AI researchers, includes reasoning capabilities, hypothesis testing, and preparing for future eventualities [1, 2024]. In earlier research, Expert Systems were developed to solve specific domain problems using knowledge-intensive software that emulated human expertise [4, 2016]. Over time, the focus has shifted towards Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs), which have gained recognition for their potential in data science and analysis [2, 2025]. These models are capable of comprehending complex human expressions governed by grammatical rules, posing a significant challenge to develop AI algorithms that understand language [3, 2025]. In terms of theoretical foundations, one approach involves mathematically formalizing essential features of informal definitions of human intelligence to create a general measure of machine intelligence [6, 2007]. However, it's important to note that the Turing Test is still widely recognized as a benchmark for assessing AI intelligence.
