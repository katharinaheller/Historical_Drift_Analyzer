Abstract—Ever since the Turing Test was proposed in the 1950s, humans have explored the mastering of language intelligence by machine..

  "model_output": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) explainability refers to the ability to interpret, understand, and communicate the decision-making process of an AI system. The challenge of explainability in AI has evolved across publications as researchers aim to develop more transparent AI models [7]. Theoretical foundations of explainable AI can be traced back to the concept of intelligence itself, with psychologists defining it as a capability that enables reasoning, hypothesis testing, and preparing for future events [7]. In AI research, this is translated into the development of machine-based intelligence capable of exhibiting human-like reasoning capabilities. Historically, the Turing Test was proposed in the 1950s as a benchmark for assessing an AI's ability to mimic human-like intelligence [1]. However, the test has evolved over time to encompass more complex and nuanced aspects of intelligence, such as reasoning [2]. More recently, large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in both academic and industrial domains due to their impressive performance [2, 4]. While these models demonstrate great potential for achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI), the need for AI evaluation persists to identify current system limitations and inform the design of more powerful models [2]. In the realm of text summarization, explainability becomes crucial as researchers work towards creating AI systems that can accurately condense complex information into concise summaries while maintaining the key points from the source text [6].
