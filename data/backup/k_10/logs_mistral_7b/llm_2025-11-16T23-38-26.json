You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3.

Evaluation has been recognized as a critical tool for identifying current system limitations and informing the design of more powerful models [1] (2024). 2. The Turing Test, proposed in the 1950s, is a widely recognized test for assessing intelligence by discerning if responses are of human or machine origin [1] (2024). It is generally believed among researchers that a computing machine that successfully passes the Turing Test can be considered as intelligent. 3. Large Language Models (LLMs) have been the subject of recent interest, with their great performance raising promise that they could be AGI in this era [1] (2024). However, the human-crafted nature of evaluation approaches has led to debate on whether GPT-4 can be seen as sparks of AGI [1] (2024). 4. To address evaluation challenges posed by the ongoing evolution of LLMs, there is a need for thorough, multifaceted evaluation techniques [1] (2024). Recent efforts include new evaluation settings that enlarge the resolution of task metrics and reduce memorization bias [5] (2025). 5. Existing research has primarily focused on natural language tasks due to the initial objective behind the development of language models being to enhance performance on such tasks [1] (2024). 6. Reproducible, verifiable, and controlled experiments have been highlighted as important in AI and knowledge engineering, with transparency playing a key role in facilitating such experimentation [3] (1990). 7. Benchmarks like DS-1000 and MLAgentBench have been introduced to provide large-scale evaluations of LLMs for data science libraries and machine learning research workflows, respectively [5] (2025).
