Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3.

  "model_output": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems learn from data through machine learning, a subset of AI that involves training algorithms to make predictions or decisions based on data [4]. The theoretical foundations of this process are rooted in statistical learning theory and computational learning theory, which focus on understanding how machines can learn from examples or data [7]. The Turing Test, proposed in the 1950s, has been a significant benchmark for assessing AI systems' intelligence by distinguishing human-like responses from machine-generated ones [2,6]. Over time, the definition of intelligence and the methods for evaluating it have evolved. Authentic intelligence is believed to include reasoning capabilities, hypothesis testing, and preparation for future eventualities [2]. In the early days of AI, expert systems were developed as knowledge-based systems that could perform tasks requiring human expertise [1]. These systems used a rule-based approach where the reasoning steps for specific problems were determined by human experts. With the rise of large language models and vision language models in recent years, generative AI has gained recognition in the field of data science and analysis [3]. Representation learning is another key concept that enables machines to learn from raw data automatically and discover the necessary representations for detection or classification [4]. In the context of AI, the focus has been on developing machine-based intelligence that can reason, test hypotheses, and prepare for future eventualities [2]. The SP theory is a more recent development in artificial intelligence, aiming to integrate concepts from computing and cognitive science with an emphasis on human-like intelligence [7]. The SP system is designed as a system for unsupervised learning, capable of exact forms of reasoning.
