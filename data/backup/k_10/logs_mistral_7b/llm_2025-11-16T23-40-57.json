Never infer missing event years. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nCompare and contrast the main theoretical perspectives on discuss how ai approaches mimic human decision-making processes., grounding historical claims only in explicit snippet content.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] 2210.07321v4.pdf (2023)\n.

  "model_output": "Comparison of Main Theoretical Perspectives on AI Approaches Mimicking Human Decision-Making Processes\n\nThe main theoretical perspectives on AI approaches mimicking human decision-making processes can be categorized as follows:\n\n1. Turing Test approach (Turing, 1950; discussed in 2023 [1])\n   - Proposes a benchmark for assessing machine intelligence based on the ability of a machine to conduct human-like conversation over a text channel. The first widely-published method dates back to 1966 with the ELIZA chatbot. 2. Normative and Descriptive Approaches (discussed in 1989 [4] and 1990 [2])\n   - Normative approaches focus on mathematical correctness and effectiveness in representing and managing uncertainty in rule-based reasoning for AI. - Descriptive approaches aim to produce interpretations of probabilistic reasoning that are more compatible with human reasoning styles (1990 [2]). 3. Empirical Study of Human Strategies for Uncertain Reasoning (discussed in 1990 [2])\n   - Researchers conducted empirical studies to investigate human strategies for uncertain reasoning, providing inspiration for the design of new modes of explaining probabilistic reasoning, such as qualitative belief propagation and scenario-based reasoning. 4. Universal Intelligence (discussed in 2007 [5])\n   - Explores the relationship between universal intelligence, human intelligence, and other proposed definitions of machine intelligence. The paper provides an overview of the complex intellectual, social, and political history of human intelligence.
