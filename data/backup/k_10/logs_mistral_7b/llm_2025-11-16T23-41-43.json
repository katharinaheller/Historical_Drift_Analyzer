You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3.

  "model_output": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) interpretability, defined as understanding how AI models arrive at their decisions and predictions, has evolved significantly across different decades, with its definition and theoretical foundations being shaped by various milestones and advancements in AI research. In the 1950s, Alan Turing proposed the Turing Test to evaluate intelligence in a machine [3]. The test aimed to determine whether a machine could exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human. This proposal marked the beginning of a quest for creating machines with human-like intelligence and sparked interest in AI research. In 2007, researchers focused on defining machine intelligence by drawing connections between it and human intelligence [4]. They reviewed well-known theories, definitions, and tests of intelligence from psychology and sought to apply these ideas to arbitrary systems and contexts. This work aimed at understanding the essence of intelligence in a broader sense for artificial systems. Over the past two decades, language modeling has been an essential approach for developing AI models capable of understanding and generating human-like language [3]. The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has made significant strides in the field of data science and analysis, and generated considerable interest among both academic and industrial communities [2]. Recently, the development and deployment of advanced LLMs, such as ChatGPT, have raised the possibility that these models could exhibit artificial general intelligence (AGI) [1]. However, it is important to emphasize that while these models possess remarkable capabilities, the debate on whether they truly embody human-like intelligence continues.
