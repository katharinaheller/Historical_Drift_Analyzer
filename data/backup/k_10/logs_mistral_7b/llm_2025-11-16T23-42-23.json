Never infer missing event years. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nCompare and contrast the main theoretical perspectives on explain how deep learning relates to previous connectionist ideas., grounding historical claims only in explicit snippet content.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] NatureDeepReview.pdf (2025)\n.

  "model_output": "Comparison of Deep Learning and Previous Connectionist Ideas:\n\nDeep learning, as described in [1], is a modern approach that builds upon traditional connectionist ideas but significantly advances them through the use of the backpropagation algorithm to train deep neural networks. Unlike classical machine learning algorithms, deep learning does not require manual feature extraction from raw data and instead learns distributed representations through composing multiple layers of non-linear transformations [1]. The primary difference between deep learning and previous connectionist ideas lies in the composition of simple but non-linear modules that form a hierarchy of abstract representations for complex function learning, which was not possible with earlier methods [1]. This approach has led to breakthroughs in various domains such as image processing, speech recognition, audio processing, text understanding, topic classification, sentiment analysis, question answering, and language translation [1]. Deep neural networks are designed to perform parallel computation for a modest number of steps, making them extremely powerful machine learning models, as described in [4]. They can even sort N-bit numbers using only two hidden layers of quadratic size [4]. However, training deep neural networks with many layers poses challenges, and research has been conducted to ease the optimization process, such as the residual learning framework presented in [2].
