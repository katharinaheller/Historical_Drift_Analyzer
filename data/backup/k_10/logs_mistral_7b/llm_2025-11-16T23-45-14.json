Provide a precise definition, clarify theoretical foundations, and explain how interpretations evolved across time and publications. Use event years ONLY if explicitly stated in the snippets. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nDefine explain how explainable ai aligns with trustworthy ai principles., describe its theoretical foundations, and explain how definitions evolved historically across publications.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] 2210.07321v4.pdf (2023)\nThird, guided by the EU Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI and research community efforts, we present our survey with sociotechnical and human-centric considerations integrated throughout, focusing not only on NLG systems and machine text detection technologies, but on the humans who will be exposed to both text generation and detection systems in daily life.

  "model_output": "Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Generative AI, has evolved significantly over time, focusing on creating machine-based intelligence that mimics human reasoning and problem-solving abilities [2]. One of the milestones in AI's history was the Turing Test, proposed in the 1950s, which aimed to evaluate whether a machine could exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from a human's [2]. Explainable AI (XAI) and Trustworthy AI (TAI) are concepts that have emerged in response to the increasing use of AI systems in various domains. The EU Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI emphasize the need to ensure AI systems are developed lawfully, ethically, and robustly, and to prevent unintended or dual-use applications that may cause harm [1]. In the context of Natural Language Generation (NLG), trustworthiness necessitates understanding potential abuses and implementing detection technologies, moderation mechanisms, government legislation, or platform policies to mitigate them [1]. The concept of XAI aligns with TAI principles by focusing on making AI systems transparent, interpretable, and accountable. This transparency can help build trust among users and society, ensuring that AI systems are used ethically and responsibly [1]. However, the evolution of these concepts is a relatively recent development, with the EU Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI being published in 2019 [1].
