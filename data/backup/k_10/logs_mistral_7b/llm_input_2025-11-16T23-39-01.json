  "prompt_final_to_llm": "You are a domain expert in Artificial Intelligence. Provide a precise definition, clarify theoretical foundations, and explain how interpretations evolved across time and publications. Use event years ONLY if explicitly stated in the snippets. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nDefine explain the concept of heuristic search as described in the corpus., describe its theoretical foundations, and explain how definitions evolved historically across publications.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] 2005.14165v4.pdf (2020)\n. By presenting a broad characterization of GPT-3's strengths and weaknesses, including these limitations, we hope to stimulate study of few-shot learning in language models and draw attention to where progress is most needed. A heuristic sense of the overall results can be seen in Figure 1.3, which aggregates the various tasks (though it should not be seen as a rigorous or meaningful benchmark in itself).\n\n[2] 1910.10683v4.pdf (2023)\nOur heuristics are inspired by past work on using Common Crawl as a source of data for NLP: For example, Grave et al. also filter text using an automatic language detector and discard short lines and Smith et al.;. Grave et al.. both perform line-level deduplication.\n\n[3] Expert_Systems.pdf (2016)\n. The basic limitation currently, is to build expert systems with heuristic and empirical knowledge rather than deep knowledge, which include models of the functional and causal relations that underlie a problem. In the future, more systems might be developed using functional and causal models using a variety of representations. . Using multiple sources of knowledge (i.e., domain experts) in a cooperative manner is still a difficult problem waiting to be tackled.\n\n[4] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\n. In current models, the main emphasis is on hill climbing and related techniques that concentrate search in areas that are proving productive without ruling out any part of the search space a priori—and with enough flexibility to be able to escape from 'local peaks'.\n\n[5] D14-1162.pdf (2014)\nThe statistics of word occurrences in a corpus is the primary source of information available to all unsupervised methods for learning word representations, and although many such methods now exist, the question still remains as to how meaning is generated from these statistics, and how the resulting word vectors might represent that meaning. In this section, we shed some light on this question. . We use our insights to construct a new model for word representation which we call GloVe, for Globa\n\n[2] 1910.10683v4.pdf (2023)\nWe also introduce our approach for treating every problem as a text-to-text task and describe our \"Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus\" (C4), the Common Crawl-based data set we created as a source of unlabeled text data.. We refer to our model and framework as the \"Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer\" (T5). mechanism after each self-attention layer that attends to the output of the encoder. . The self-attention mechanism in the decoder also uses a form of autoregressive or causal selfattention, which on\n\n[2] 1910.10683v4.pdf (2023)\n. To address these issues, we used the following heuristics for cleaning up Common Crawl's web extracted text: • We only retained lines that ended in a terminal punctuation mark (i.e. a period, exclamation mark, question mark, or end quotation mark).. • We discarded any page with fewer than 3 sentences and only retained lines that contained at least 5 words. . • . We removed any page that contained any word on the \"List of Dirty, Naughty, Obscene or Otherwise Bad Words\".6 • . Many of the scraped\n\n[2] 1910.10683v4.pdf (2023)\nHowever, we opted to create a new data set because prior data sets use a more limited set of filtering heuristics, are not publicly available, and/or are different in scope (e.g. are limited to News data (Zellers et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019c), comprise only Creative Commons content, or are focused on parallel training data for machine translation ). . To assemble our base data set, we downloaded the web extracted text from April 2019 and applied the aforementioned filtering. . This produces a\n\n[6] 0712.3329v1.pdf (2007)\n.
