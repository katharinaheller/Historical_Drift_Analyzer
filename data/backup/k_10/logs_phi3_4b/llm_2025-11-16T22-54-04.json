  "model_output": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field focused on developing machine-based intelligence, as opposed to natural intelligence that characterizes humans. The Turing Test, proposed in the 1950s [4], serves as a benchmark for assessing AI by discerning if responses are of human or machine origin. A computing machine that successfully passes the Turing Test can be considered intelligent [1]. The theoretical foundations of AI are rooted in creating systems capable of human-like intelligence and understanding complex human expressions like language [4]. Over time, different approaches to AI have emerged. Expert systems (ES), one of the earlier research fields, were defined as knowledge-intensive software that can perform tasks requiring human expertise and behave as an artificial advisory system for a particular problem domain [3]. Large Language Models (LLMs) or vision language models (VLMs have gained increasing recognition in recent years due to their potential in data science and analysis. While some researchers argue that the great performance of LLMs has raised the promise that they could be AGI, it is essential to note that substantial evidence for this claim is still missing [1]. The definition of machine intelligence continues to evolve as new theories, definitions, and tests are proposed by psychologists [5]. However, a universally accepted definition remains elusive, given the complexity and richness of human intelligence. Finally, it's worth noting that AI's development also involves addressing issues such as trustworthiness, potential abuses, and mitigation measures [6].
