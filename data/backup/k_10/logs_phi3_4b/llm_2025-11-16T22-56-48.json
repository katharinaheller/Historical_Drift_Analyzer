  "model_output": "The mechanisms, criteria, and definitions for judging machine intelligence have evolved over time, as evidenced by various papers [1], [2], [3], and [4]. In 1950, Turing proposed the \"imitation game\" or Turing Test, which assesses a machine's ability to converse with humans over text channels [2]. In 1966, the ELIZA chatbot became the first widely-published method for conducting this test [2]. The paper from 2007 [1] provides an alternative approach to defining machine intelligence. It presents a formal definition that captures the concept of machine intelligence in a broad sense, extracting essential features from various informal definitions given by experts [1]. The authors aim for their definition to be applicable to many kinds of systems [1]. While there is no explicit mention of specific tests or criteria beyond the Turing Test and its variations in the provided context, it can be deduced that researchers focus on developing machine-based intelligence that equips machines with reasoning capabilities, hypothesis testing, and future preparedness [3]. Additionally, some papers discuss the limitations of existing models like GPT-3 [4], highlighting areas for further research.
