You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3.

  "model_output": "Comparison of Symbolic Reasoning and Statistical Learning Paradigms:\n\nSymbolic reasoning, as described in [2], focuses on rule-based approaches for uncertain reasoning that are intended to be more compatible with human reasoning styles. This perspective was inspired by an empirical study of human strategies for uncertain reasoning conducted in the 1990s [2]. However, there is evidence suggesting that normatively appealing probabilistic and decision theoretic schemes are poor models of human reasoning under uncertainty (e.g., Kahneman et al. 1982), but there is surprisingly little experimental evidence that rule-based alternatives, such as certainty factors or fuzzy logic, are any better as descriptive models [2]. Statistical learning paradigms, on the other hand, focus on learning from data and statistical patterns. An example of this approach can be found in [1], where a global log-bilinear regression model was introduced for the unsupervised learning of word representations. The model outperforms other models on various tasks such as word analogy, similarity, and named entity recognition [1]. In recent years, there has been an increase in the development of methods for transfer learning in Natural Language Processing (NLP), as outlined in [3]. This work aims to provide a comprehensive perspective on the field by comparing different transfer learning objectives, unlabeled data sets, and other factors. However, the rapid rate of progress and diversity of techniques make it challenging to compare different algorithms and tease apart the effects of new contributions [3]. The need for a unified comparison framework for factual consistency evaluation methods was highlighted in [7], as there were limited reference values for related scores compared to binary labels. Regarding analogies, it is mentioned in [5] that the rapid progress of machine translation using transformer models has raised doubts about whether understanding a sentence requires anything like the internal symbolic expressions manipulated by using inference rules. Instead, it is more compatible with the view that everyday reasoning involves many simultaneous analogies.
