Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3.

  "model_output": "The quality of training data plays a crucial role in the performance of AI systems, particularly large language models (LLMs). [1], [2], [3] and [5] provide insights into this relationship. [1] (2020) highlights that while task-agnostic architectures are desirable, they still require fine-tuning on task-specific datasets for strong performance. This implies that the quality of training data is essential for achieving desired results in AI systems. [3] (2025) further supports this claim by stating that the amount of available data for training LLMs is a potential issue, suggesting that higher quality data could lead to better model performance. [5] (2023) demonstrates the scalability of neural networks, implying that larger models trained on larger datasets often perform better. This underscores the importance of high-quality training data for improving AI system performance. However, [4] (2025) points out a barrier to data analysis: the lack of systematic statistical training among individuals without a background in statistics. This could potentially affect the quality of training data used in AI systems if not properly managed. [2] (2024) emphasizes the importance of AI model evaluation, which is crucial for identifying system limitations and designing more powerful models. This suggests that high-quality training data is essential for accurate model evaluation and subsequent improvement of AI systems. In summary, the quality of training data is a significant factor in the performance of AI systems, particularly large language models. [1], [2], [3], [4] and [5] all provide evidence supporting this claim.
