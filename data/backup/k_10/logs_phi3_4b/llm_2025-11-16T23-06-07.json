  "model_output": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) uses symbolic representation to enable inference through the manipulation of internal symbols according to predefined rules [6]. Symbolic AI, which emerged in the 1950s [3], is based on the idea that an intelligent system can be constructed by encoding knowledge as symbolic expressions and using logical inference rules to reason with them. Theoretical foundations of symbolic representation in AI involve two main components: syntax (the formal structure of symbols) and semantics (the meaning associated with these symbols). Syntax defines the combination, manipulation, and transformation rules for symbols, while semantics represents the interpretation of symbols as a means to represent knowledge. Historically, symbolic representation has evolved from simple production systems to more complex expert systems and knowledge-based systems [6]. Early attempts at AI used rule-based systems for problem solving, such as the General Problem Solver (GPS) developed by Newell and Simon in the 1950s [3]. In the 1970s and 1980s, expert systems were introduced to handle specific domains of knowledge, like MYCIN for diagnosing bacterial infections [6]. Symbolic representation also played a crucial role in the development of logical reasoning. The resolution principle, proposed by Rescher and Mann in the 1970s [4], is an example of a logical inference rule that has been widely used to make deductions based on symbolic representations. More recent developments in AI have led to the emergence of machine learning, which often relies on different types of representations, such as distributed representations and learned features [1]. These methods allow machines to automatically discover the necessary representations needed for detection or classification tasks. While these techniques do not strictly follow the symbolic representation paradigm, they still involve a form of internal representation that can enable inference through the use of neural networks and deep learning algorithms. Text summarization is another area where symbolic representation has been applied, with extractive [2] and abstractive summarization methods selecting and generating summaries based on sentence representations and grammar rules [5]. In conclusion, symbolic representation has played a significant role in the development of AI, enabling logical reasoning, expert systems, and knowledge-based systems. However, modern AI research also employs other types of internal representations like distributed and learned features for various tasks.
