Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4.

  "model_output": "The mechanisms, strengths, and limitations of AI performance improvement over time through feedback loops can be analyzed as follows:\n\n1. Feedback loops play a crucial role in AI performance improvement [1]. This is evident from the fact that large language models (LLMs) have shown significant improvements due to the increase in parameters and subsequent evaluation of their limitations, which informs the design of more powerful models [1]. 2. The importance of AI evaluation is emphasized as a critical tool for identifying system limitations and improving performance [1]. For instance, supervised models have been found to outperform zero-shot models, demonstrating that merely increasing parameters does not guarantee a higher level of social knowledge [1]. 3. Reasoning is one of the significant challenges for an intelligent AI model [1]. To effectively tackle reasoning tasks, models need to comprehend provided information and utilize reasoning and inference [1]. However, the specific role of feedback loops in improving reasoning abilities is not explicitly stated in the provided context. 4. The Turing Test, a benchmark for assessing AI intelligence by discerning human-like responses from machine-generated ones, has been a longstanding objective in AI evolution [1]. Passing the Turing Test indicates a machine's potential intelligence [1]. 5. Generative AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), have gained increasing recognition in recent years for their potential in data science and analysis [3]. These models can communicate with humans effectively, reason on mathematical problems, and align well with human values for safe use [4]. However, the role of feedback loops in enhancing these capabilities is not explicitly stated. 6. There is insufficient evidence to determine how feedback loops specifically improve the interpretability of AI models from the provided context. Self-attention mechanisms are mentioned as a potential approach to increase computational performance for tasks involving long sequences [6], but the role of feedback loops in this context is not explicit.
