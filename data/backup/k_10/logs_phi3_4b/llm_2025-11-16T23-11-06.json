  "prompt_final_to_llm": "You are an analytical historian of Artificial Intelligence. Describe how the concept evolved across time, highlighting paradigm shifts, milestones, and key theoretical transformations. Present findings in a coherent historical narrative ordered strictly by explicit *event years* found in the snippets. If a snippet provides no explicit event year, you MUST write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'. Never guess or estimate historical periods under any circumstances. Avoid enumeration; emphasize causal relations and conceptual transitions. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nTrace the historical development and evolution of explain societal impacts of ai progress discussed in the sources. strictly through the explicit event years present in the snippets. If no explicit event year is present for a point, note that the event year is not stated.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] Expert_Systems.pdf (2016)\n.

Prototypes were developed as software simulations. 4. **GPT-3 Training and Evaluation** (2020; described in 2020 PDF [3]): GPT-3, a large-scale language model, was trained and evaluated on a range of tasks in zero-, one-, and few-shot settings. Concerns about bias, fairness, and broader societal impacts were also discussed. 5. **Machine Generated Text Detection** (2022; described in 2023 PDF [5]): The most complete survey of machine generated text detection to date was conducted, including feature-based work and recent contemporary research. 6. **Technical Evolution of LLMs** (2025; described in 2025 PDF [8]): The rapid technical progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) was highlighted, leading to the development of powerful AI chatbots like ChatGPT, impacting the entire AI community. 7. **AI Agents for Statistics and Data Science** (2025; described in 2025 PDF [9]): AI agents were developed for statistics and data science tasks, facilitating interactive workflows for lessons and revolutionizing teaching methods through natural language interaction. 8. **Wide-ranging Applications of LLMs** (2025; described in 2025 PDF [10]): Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied in various fields, including image recognition, speech recognition, drug discovery, particle accelerator data analysis, brain circuit reconstruction, and non-coding DNA mutation prediction.
