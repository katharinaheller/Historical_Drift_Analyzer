Never infer missing event years. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number.

You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nCompare and contrast the main theoretical perspectives on outline the core subfields of ai mentioned in the corpus., grounding historical claims only in explicit snippet content.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n. Within the scope of AI, the Turing Test, a widely recognized test for assessing intelligence by discerning if responses are of human or machine origin, has been a longstanding objective in AI evolution.

While this is a significant achievement, the energy cost of creating such a model is still nontrivial, and repeated efforts to replicate a model of this size will only amplify the growing compute footprint of these LLMs. We believe the entire AI community — academic researchers, civil society, policymakers, and industry — must work together to develop clear 125M 6.0e−4 0.5M 350M 3.0e−4 0.5M 1.3B . 2.0e−4 1M 2.7B 1.6e−4 1M 6.7B . 1.2e−4 2M 13B 1.0e−4 4M 30B 1.0e−4 4M 66B 0.8e−4 2M 175B 1.2e−4 2\n\n[8] 1910.10683v4.pdf (2023)\n.

Turing Test and Machine Intelligence (event year not stated; described in [1])\n   - The Turing Test is a widely recognized benchmark for assessing the intelligence of machines, with the goal that passing this test implies machine intelligence. 2. Universal Intelligence and Mainstream Views (event year not stated; described in [3])\n   - Universal intelligence is a broad concept encompassing reasoning capabilities, hypothesis testing, and preparing for future events. Researchers focus on the development of machine-based intelligence, contrasted with human intelligence and other proposed definitions of machine intelligence. 3. Binet Intelligence Test (event year not stated; described in [3])\n   - The Binet Intelligence test was developed to predict children's academic performance. It was found that the results were a good indicator of this outcome. 4. Text Generation and Natural Language Processing (NLP) (event year not stated; described in [2] and [4])\n   - Text generation, also known as natural language generation, is a significant subfield of NLP that aims to produce human-like text based on input data. Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained recognition for their potential in data science and analysis. 5. Machine Generated Text Detection (event year not stated; described in [5])\n   - There is currently only one general survey on detection of machine generated text, with the focus on methods targeting these specific detections. The survey also emphasizes the importance of trustworthy AI in preventing abuses and attacks related to NLG models.
