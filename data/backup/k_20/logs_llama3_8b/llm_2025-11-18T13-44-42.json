Never infer missing event years. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nCompare and contrast the main theoretical perspectives on explain the contribution of expert knowledge bases to early ai success., grounding historical claims only in explicit snippet content.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] Expert_Systems.pdf (2016)\n.

Expert Systems (mid-1970s; described in 2016 PDF [1]):\n   - Definition: Knowledge-intensive software that can perform tasks requiring human expertise. - Contribution: They were one of the earlier research fields in Artificial Intelligence and found applications in various areas like engineering, chemistry, medicine, industry, etc. (described in 2016 PDF [1]). The knowledge base consists of IF–THEN rules and the inference engine determines how the system reasons using these rules (described in 2016 PDF [1]). 2. Machine Generated Text Detection (date not stated; described in 2023 PDF [2]):\n   - Contribution: This work provides a comprehensive survey of machine-generated text detection, including previously omitted feature-based work and findings from recent contemporary research (described in 2023 PDF [2]). 3. Large Language Models (LLMs) (date not stated; described in 2025 PDF [6]):\n   - Definition: AI models capable of generating human-like text based on input data. - Contribution: LLMs have gained recognition in recent years for their potential impact on the field of data science and analysis (described in 2025 PDF [6]). The technical evolution of LLMs has been making an important impact on the entire AI community, leading to advancements such as ChatGPT (described in 2025 PDF [7]). In terms of early AI success, expert systems were one of the pioneering contributions that demonstrated the viability and usefulness of artificial intelligence in various domains. However, LLMs represent a more recent development that is revolutionizing the way AI algorithms are developed and used (described in 2025 PDF [7]).
