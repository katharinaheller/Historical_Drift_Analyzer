By presenting a broad characterization of GPT-3's strengths and weaknesses, including these limitations, we hope to stimulate study of few-shot learning in language models and draw attention to where progress is most needed. A heuristic sense of the overall results can be seen in Figure 1.3, which aggregates the various tasks (though it should not be seen as a rigorous or meaningful benchmark in itself).\n\n[3] 2303.18223v16.pdf (2025)\n. Since LLMs are trained to capture the data characteristics of pre-training corpora (including both high-quality and low-quality data), they are likely to generate toxic, biased, or even harmful content for humans. It is necessary to align LLMs with human values, e.g., helpful, honest, and harmless. . For this purpose, InstructGPT designs an effective tuning approach that enables LLMs to follow the expected instructions, which utilizes the technique of reinforcement learning with human feedback\n\n[5] 2201.05273v4.pdf (2022)\n. Recent studies have shown that first training PLMs on data-rich intermediate labeled datasets (e.g., a similar NLP task from the same target domain) before finetuning them on data-scarce target text generation tasks can achieve better performance in target tasks.\n\n[6] 2210.07321v4.pdf (2023)\n.

In 2020, Kaplan et al.

Our basic pre-training approach, including model, data, and training, is similar to the process described in [RWC+19], with relatively straightforward scaling up of the model size, dataset size and diversity, and length of training.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe our approach and methods for training GPT-3 and evaluating it. .

Within the scope of AI, the Turing Test, a widely recognized test for assessing intelligence by discerning if responses are of human or machine origin, has been a longstanding objective in AI evolution.

  "model_output": "The training data quality plays a significant role in the performance of AI systems, particularly in the case of large language models (LLMs). [2], [3], [4]\n\nThe strength of LLMs lies in their ability to solve diverse tasks and capture the characteristics of pre-training corpora, including both high-quality and low-quality data. However, this can lead to issues such as generating toxic, biased, or harmful content for humans. To address this, efforts are made to align LLMs with human values, such as being helpful, honest, and harmless. [3]\n\nThe quality of the training data significantly impacts the performance of downstream tasks. An empirical study has shown that even when approaching the point of diminishing returns, improving representation quality or semantic content can still be beneficial. Additionally, recent studies suggest that pre-training on data-rich intermediate labeled datasets before finetuning on data-scarce target tasks can achieve better performance in target tasks. [3], [5]\n\nHowever, the need for task-specific datasets and fine-tuning remains a limitation. Achieving strong performance on a desired task typically requires fine-tuning on a dataset of thousands to hundreds of thousands of examples specific to that task. Removing this limitation would be desirable. [1]\n\nLastly, it's important to note that supervised models significantly outperform zero-shot models in terms of performance, suggesting that an increase in parameters does not necessarily guarantee a higher level of social knowledge.
