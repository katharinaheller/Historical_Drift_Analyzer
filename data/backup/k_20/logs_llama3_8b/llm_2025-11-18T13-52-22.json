Abstract—Ever since the Turing Test was proposed in the 1950s, humans have explored the mastering of language intelligence by machine.. Language is essentially a complex, intricate system of human expressions governed by grammatical rules. It poses a significant challenge to develop capable artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language.\n\n[4] 2210.07321v4.pdf (2023)\nThe EU ethics guidelines for trustworthy AI emphasize that unintended or dual-use applications of AI systems should be taken into account, and that steps should be taken to prevent and mitigate abuse of AI systems to cause harm.\n\n[7] 1304.1082v1.pdf (1990)\n.

In this paper we approach the problem of defining machine intelligence as follows: Section 2 overviews well known theories, definitions and tests of intelligence that have been developed by psychologists. Our objective in this section is to gain an understanding of the essence of intelligence in the broadest possible terms. . In particular we are interested in commonly expressed ideas that could be applied to arbitrary systems and contexts, not just humans. . Section 3 takes these key ideas an\n\n[7] 1304.1082v1.pdf (1990)\nWhile there is ample evidence that normatively appealing probabilistic and decision theoretic schemes are poor models of human reasoning under uncertainty (e.g. Kahneman et a/. 1982), there is surprisingly little experimental evidence that the rule-based alternatives, such as certainty factors or fuzzy logic, are any better as descriptive models. And even if successful descriptively, the emulative approach would merely reproduce the documented deficiencies of our intuitive reasoning rather than\n\n[8] 0712.3329v1.pdf (2007)\n. In the current paper we explore universal intelligence in much greater detail, in particular the way in which it relates to mainstream views on human intelligence and other proposed definitions of machine intelligence. Human intelligence is an enormously rich topic with a complex intellectual, social and political history. . For an overview the interested reader might want to consult \"Handbook of Intelligence\" .

Our objective in this section is simply to sk\n\n[8] 0712.3329v1.pdf (2007)\nTo measure the intelligence of such diverse systems in a meaningful way we must step back from the specifics of particular systems and establish the underlying fundamentals of what it is that we are really trying to measure. The difficulty of developing an abstract and highly general notion of intelligence is readily apparent. . Consider, for example, the memory and numerical computation tasks that appear in some intelligence tests and which were once regarded as defining hallmarks of human inte\n\n[4] 2210.07321v4.pdf (2023)\nAs such, trustworthy AI in the context of NLG necessitates understanding the areas where such models may be abused, and how these abuses may be prevented (either with detection technologies, moderation mechanisms, government legislation, or platform policies). When discussing attacks, we discuss not only the direct impact on targets, but also the broader impacts of both attacks and mitigation measures on trust.\n\n[4] 2210.07321v4.pdf (2023)\n. To summarize, the major contributions of this work are as follows: • The most complete survey of machine generated text detection to date, including previously omitted feature-based work and findings from recent contemporary research.. • The first detailed review of the threat models enabled by machine generated text, at a critical juncture where NLG models and tools are rapidly improving and proliferating. . • . A meaningful exploration of both topics through the lens of Trustworthy AI (TAI),\n\n[7] 1304.1082v1.pdf (1990)\n.

  "model_output": "The notion of transparency in AI decision processes refers to the capability for humans to understand and interpret the reasoning behind an AI's decisions, particularly in complex and unstructured environments. The theoretical foundations of this concept can be traced back to the 1990s, as highlighted by the work on the Bayes net formalism [1]. Here, transparency is achieved through a verifiable, reproducible, and controlled experimental setup that allows outsiders (i.e., people other than the system's designers) to investigate and validate knowledge engineering exercises. In more recent years, the evolution of AI has brought forth new challenges and perspectives on transparency. For instance, Artificial Intelligence researchers focus on developing machine-based intelligence [2] and exploring the mastery of language intelligence by machines [6]. The concept of trustworthy AI (TAI) is also crucial, as it emphasizes understanding areas where such models may be abused and taking steps to prevent and mitigate potential harm [4]. Over time, definitions and interpretations of transparency in AI have expanded beyond the scope of individual systems and contexts, aiming to establish a highly general notion of intelligence that applies to diverse domains. However, insufficient evidence is provided on how these definitions have evolved specifically across publications.
