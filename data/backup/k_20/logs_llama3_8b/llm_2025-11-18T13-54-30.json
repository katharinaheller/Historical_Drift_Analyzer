  "prompt_final_to_llm": "You are a comparative analyst. Compare major frameworks or schools of thought, specifying explicit historical information only when stated in the provided snippets. Never infer missing event years. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nCompare and contrast the main theoretical perspectives on discuss how knowledge abstraction differs between symbolic and neural models., grounding historical claims only in explicit snippet content.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] NatureDeepReview.pdf (2025)\nN-grams treat each word as an atomic unit, so they cannot generalize across semantically related sequences of words, whereas neural language models can because they associate each word with a vector of real valued features, and semantically related words end up close to each other in that vector space (Fig. 4).

  "model_output": "Knowledge abstraction, as applied to symbolic and neural models, presents significant differences due to their underlying structures and approaches to data representation. Symbolic models, such as expert systems [6], are designed to manipulate symbolic expressions using rules and heuristics. In these models, knowledge is represented through classes, objects, methods, messages, and links [4]. However, they struggle with handling large volumes of data efficiently [3]. Neural models, on the other hand, focus on learning representations of words or phrases as vectors in a continuous space [1], [3], [5]. For instance, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and deep neural networks are used for language understanding and generation tasks [1], [2], [5]. These models can capture semantic relationships between input and output data more effectively than traditional neural generative models due to their cross-attention mechanisms [2]. In terms of computational complexity, simpler models like the ones discussed in [3] may not represent the data as precisely as neural networks but can be trained on larger amounts of data more efficiently. Deep learning has been applied to speech and handwriting recognition for a long time, with new paradigms needed to replace rule-based manipulation of symbolic expressions by operations on large vectors [1]. However, deep learning models still face challenges in handling certain types of knowledge, such as functional and causal relations that underlie problems [6].
