You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3.

We analyze and make explicit the model properties needed for such regularities to emerge in word vectors. . The result is a new global logbilinear regression model that combines the advantages of the two major model families\n\n[6] D14-1162.pdf (2014)\nWith this in mind, we choose to use 5To demonstrate the scalability of the model, we also trained it on a much larger sixth corpus, containing 840 billion tokens of web data, but in this case we did not lowercase the vocabulary, so the results are not directly comparable. 6For the model trained on Common Crawl data, we use a larger vocabulary of about 2 million words. . We present results on the word analogy task in Table 2. . The GloVe model performs significantly better than the other baseline\n\n[2] 3641289.pdf (2024)\nThis statement demonstrates that supervised models significantly outperform zero-shot models in terms of performance, highlighting that an increase in parameters does not necessarily guarantee a higher level of social knowledge in this particular scenario.. 3.1.2.

A variety of newer models also pursue this approach, including a study (Bullinaria and Levy, 2007) that indicates that positive pointwise mutual information (PPMI) is a good transformation. .

Although the GPT-3's paper does not explicitly discuss the emergent abilities of LLMs, we can observe large performance leap that might transcend the basic scaling law, e.g., larger models have significantly stronger ICL ability (illustrated in the original Figure 1.2 of the GPT-3's paper ). Overall, GPT-3 can be viewed as a remarkable landmark in the journey evolving from PLMs to LLMs. .

  "model_output": "The main theoretical perspectives on explaining the emergence of hybrid AI models can be traced back to several key developments in AI research, as illustrated by the provided context snippets [1-7]. 1. (1990; described in 1304.1081v1.pdf [4]) Hybrid models were introduced to combine deterministic and probabilistic components, providing a more expressive and powerful language representation scheme. Shachter's work on numeric influence diagrams was instrumental in specifying deterministic variables in probabilistic network representations, which led to the development of hybrid models. 2. (1990-2025; described in 1304.1081v1.pdf [4], 2210.07321v4.pdf [7]) The evolution of AI models from deterministic to probabilistic and then hybrid can be observed through various publications. For instance, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recent years has been a significant advancement, as demonstrated by the GPT-3 model [2303.18223v16.pdf [3]]. 3. (2014; described in D14-1162.pdf [6]) The development of semantic vector space models of language, such as Word2Vec and GloVe, aimed to capture fine-grained semantic and syntactic regularities using vector arithmetic. These models have played a crucial role in the progression towards hybrid AI models by making explicit the model properties needed for such regularities to emerge in word vectors. 4. (2014-2025; described in D14-1162.pdf [6], 3641289.pdf [2]) Recent methods for learning vector space representations of words have succeeded in capturing fine-grained semantic and syntactic regularities using various transformations, including positive pointwise mutual information (PPMI) and Hellinger PCA. These techniques have contributed to the development of more sophisticated AI models over the years. 5. (2022; described in 2205.01068v4.pdf [5]) The growth in the size of AI models, such as LLMs and Transformer-based NLG models, has been a critical factor in their evolution towards hybrid models. Exceptions include work by EleutherAI, Salesforce, Meta AI, and the BigScience workshop (huggingface.co/), which have released dense models up to 20B, 13B, and sparse models up to 1.1T in size. 6. (2023; described in 2210.07321v4.pdf [7]) A growing concern for social media platforms is the possibility that a large number of users may begin using generative AI models, including NLG models, to produce social media content in ways that harm these platforms. This represents a new threat model that must be considered in the ongoing development and deployment of hybrid AI models.
