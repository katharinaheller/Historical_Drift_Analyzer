To summarize, the major contributions of this work are as follows: • The most complete survey of machine generated text detection to date, including previously omitted feature-based work and findings from recent contemporary research.. • The first detailed review of the threat models enabled by machine generated text, at a critical juncture where NLG models and tools are rapidly improving and proliferating. . • .

Although the GPT-3's paper does not explicitly discuss the emergent abilities of LLMs, we can observe large performance leap that might transcend the basic scaling law, e.g., larger models have significantly stronger ICL ability (illustrated in the original Figure 1.2 of the GPT-3's paper ). Overall, GPT-3 can be viewed as a remarkable landmark in the journey evolving from PLMs to LLMs. .

The technical evolution of LLMs has been making an important impact on the entire AI community, which would revolutionize the way how we develop and use AI algorithms. . Considering this rapid technical progress, in this survey, we review the recent advance\n\n[7] 1910.10683v4.pdf (2023)\nThis is a natural fit for neural networks, which have been shown to exhibit remarkable scalability, i.e. it is often possible to achieve better performance simply by training a larger model on a larger data set (Hestness et al., 2017; Shazeer et al., 2017; Jozefowicz et al., 2016; Mahajan et al., 2018; Radford et al., 2019; Shazeer et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2018b; Keskar et al., 2019a).\n\n[3] 2303.18223v16.pdf (2025)\n. An empirical study from the OpenAI team has shown that representation quality or semantic content can still effectively improve even if approaching the point of diminishing returns (i.e., approaching the irreducible loss). This finding suggests that training large models are promising for improving the performance of downstream tasks. . To further explore scaling effect, a potential issue is that the amount of available data for training LLMs is actually limited. . With the ever-increasing mod\n\n[5] 2210.07321v4.pdf (2023)\nWe summarize our key findings as follows: • NLG models have significant potential for abuse in improving scaling and targeting of existing attacks • Platforms that receive text submissions of any kind are likely to face a growing influx of machine-generated text content, particularly as user-friendly tools continue to be developed • Much of the research on NLG-enabled influence operations focuses on AI-generated news articles, while sociological data suggest that machine generated comments may p\n\n[3] 2303.18223v16.pdf (2025)\n.

  "model_output": "The mechanisms, strengths, and limitations of improving AI performance over time through feedback loops can be analyzed as follows:\n\n1. Feedback loops have been identified as a critical tool to identify system limitations and inform the design of more powerful models [1]. This is supported by research on large language models (LLMs) that have shown significant performance improvements, raising hope for achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) in this era [1]. 2. Supervised models significantly outperform zero-shot models in terms of performance, indicating an increase in parameters does not necessarily guarantee a higher level of social knowledge [1]. However, there is still a need for task-specific datasets and fine-tuning to achieve strong performance on a desired task [2]. 3. Reasoning poses significant challenges for AI models. To effectively tackle reasoning tasks, models need to comprehend the provided information, utilize reasoning and inference, and maintain context across multiple turns [1]. 4. The Turing Test has been a longstanding objective in AI evolution, serving as a benchmark for assessing intelligence by discerning if responses are of human or machine origin [1]. The chronicle of AI can be depicted as the timeline of creation and evaluation of intelligent models and systems [1]. 5. LLMs have gained increasing recognition in recent years due to their potential in data science and analysis [4]. They possess a vast store of knowledge, skill at reasoning on mathematical problems, and align well with human values for safe use [3]. The launch of ChatGPT, based on GPT models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4), further extends the capabilities of LLMs [3]. 6. Scaling neural networks to a significant size can lead to huge improvements in performance [7]. However, the amount of available data for training LLMs is actually limited [3]. With the ever-increasing model sizes, research on data efficiency and scaling effects becomes increasingly important.
