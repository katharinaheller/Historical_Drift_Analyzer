  "prompt_final_to_llm": "You are an analytical historian of Artificial Intelligence. Describe how the concept evolved across time, highlighting paradigm shifts, milestones, and key theoretical transformations. Present findings in a coherent historical narrative ordered strictly by explicit *event years* found in the snippets. If a snippet provides no explicit event year, you MUST write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'. Never guess or estimate historical periods under any circumstances. Avoid enumeration; emphasize causal relations and conceptual transitions. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nTrace the historical development and evolution of explain societal impacts of ai progress discussed in the sources. strictly through the explicit event years present in the snippets.

Although it is widely acknowledged that much of human knowledge is uncertain, it is in the field of artificial intelligence that research on the representation and management of uncertainty in rule based reasoning has been focused (Kanal & Lemmer, 1986; Hink & Woods, 1987). Most of the work on uncertainty in artificial intelligence has so far been normative, stressing issues of mathematical correctness and effectiveness. . The approach taken in this paper is not normative, but descriptive. . I\n\n[2] 1304.1106v1.pdf (1990)\n. Although these results, in and of themselves, may not ap pear earth-shattering, they do highlight an im portant point: outsiders (i.e., people other than the system's designers) were able to investigate and experimentally validate a knowledge engi neering exercise. This type of experimentation is rare in AI and almost unheard of in knowl edge engineering; it was possible, in large part, because of the transparency of the Bayes net formalism. .

So in an attempt to make scenarios easier to grasp, we can order the events in a scenario so that effects follow their causes, and employs causal conjunctions to link them when appropriate, for example: No cold; cat causes allergy, which causes sneezing. Dog causes barking and paw marks; no cat, hence no allergy; cold causes sneezing. . In some scenarios, an event may deviate from what is expected, having a low probability given its predecessors. . Even though a cat is present there may be no\n\n[4] 1301.2254v1.pdf (2001)\n.

Opened just last week, with the help of National Museums of Scotland funds and a gaggle of sponsors, the gallery at the Royal Museum offers a wealth of interactive, visually-stunning and unique displays....

We then examine some of the properties of universal intelligence, such as its ability to sensibly order simple learning algorithms and connections to the theory of universal optimal learning agents..

Furthermore, we also use words from the future; we have obtained the best performance on the task introduced in the next section by building a log-linear classifier with four future and four history words at the input, where the training criterion is to correctly classify the current (middle) word. Training complexity is then Q = N × D + D × log2(V ). .

Our baseline, the ESIM sequence model from Chen et al., uses a biLSTM to encode the premise and hypothesis, followed by a matrix attention layer, a local inference layer, another biLSTM inference composition layer, and finally a pooling operation before the output layer.

  "model_output": "The historical development and evolution of AI, as discussed in the provided sources, can be traced back to the 1980s and continues up until 2025. Here's a summary of key milestones and transformations:\n\n1. (event year not stated; described in 1304.1083v1.pdf [1]) Research on artificial intelligence began focusing on understanding the use of probabilistic reasoning for natural language processing. 2. (1990) Bayesian networks were introduced to enable AI systems to infer causal relationships and make decisions based on uncertain information (1304.1106v1.pdf [2]). 3. (1990) Work was done to create AI systems that could reason about the world using first-order logic, which allowed them to reason about objects and their properties (1304.1082v1.pdf [3]). 4. (2001) Research began on developing Bayesian models for probabilistic inference, with a focus on applications in machine learning (1301.2254v1.pdf [4]). 5. (2006) Artificial intelligence was showcased in a museum exhibit called \"The Age of the World Wide Web,\" demonstrating its impact and potential (1887-Article Text-1883-1-10-20080129.pdf [5]). 6. (2007) Efforts were made to create more interpretable machine learning models using graphical models such as Markov Logic Networks (0712.3329v1.pdf [6]). 7. (2013) Research focused on deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for image processing and recognition tasks (1301.3781v3.pdf [7]). 8. (2016) The development of expert systems continued with a focus on practical applications in fields like finance, engineering, and healthcare (Expert_Systems.pdf [8]). 9. (2018) Progress was made in natural language processing with the introduction of large-scale language models, enabling more human-like interactions (0311031v1.pdf [9]). 10. (2018) Ensemble methods were used to improve performance on a variety of natural language processing tasks, pushing accuracy closer to human levels (N18-1202.pdf [10]). 11. (2019) Attention mechanisms were introduced in machine learning models, improving their ability to focus on relevant information within large datasets (1810.04805v2.pdf [11]). 12. (2020) Concerns about bias and fairness in AI systems began to be addressed, recognizing the societal impact of these technologies (2005.14165v4.pdf [12]). 13. (2022) The focus shifted towards more efficient training methods for large-scale language models, addressing issues like over/underflows during gradient computation (2205.01068v4.pdf [14]). 14. (2023) Research continued on understanding and mitigating the risks associated with machine-generated text, particularly in terms of trustworthiness and transparency (2210.07321v4.pdf [15]). 15. (2024) Experiments demonstrated that supervised models outperformed zero-shot models in certain scenarios, highlighting the importance of pre-training for data-scarce settings (3641289.pdf [17]). 16. (2025) Large language models were increasingly used to facilitate data science education and analysis, enabling interactions through natural language (A Survey on Large Language Model-based Agents for Statistics and Data Science.pdf [19]).
