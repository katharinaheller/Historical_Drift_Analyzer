Never infer missing event years. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nCompare and contrast the main theoretical perspectives on summarize regulatory perspectives on ai in the 2020s., grounding historical claims only in explicit snippet content.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n. Within the scope of AI, the Turing Test, a widely recognized test for assessing intelligence by discerning if responses are of human or machine origin, has been a longstanding objective in AI evolution. It is generally believed among researchers that a computing machine that successfully passes the Turing Test can be considered as intelligent. .

In the current paper we explore universal intelligence in much greater detail, in particular the way in which it relates to mainstream views on human intelligence and other proposed definitions of machine intelligence.

Although these results, in and of themselves, may not ap pear earth-shattering, they do highlight an im portant point: outsiders (i.e., people other than the system's designers) were able to investigate and experimentally validate a knowledge engi neering exercise.

  "model_output": "Comparative Analysis of Regulatory Perspectives on AI in the 2020s:\n\n1. The Turing Test, a benchmark for assessing intelligence by discerning human and machine responses, has been a significant objective in AI evolution since the 1950s [1]. 2. In recent years, there has been growing recognition of the potential of generative AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), in data science and analysis [4]. 3. Mainstream approaches to text summarization based on PLMs are either extractive or abstractive [3]. Extractive summarization selects a subset of sentences from the source text, while abstractive summarization generates the summary. 4. Trustworthy AI (TAI) in the context of Natural Language Generation (NLG) necessitates understanding areas where such models may be abused and prevention strategies like detection technologies, moderation mechanisms, government legislation, or platform policies [2]. 5. The EU Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI emphasize preventing unintended or dual-use applications of AI systems to cause harm [2]. 6. In 2020, Kaplan et al. first proposed a power-law relationship between model performance and three factors (model size, dataset size, training compute) for neural language models [6]. 7. The interplay between social media creators and generative models represents important societal implications [2].
