Abstract—Ever since the Turing Test was proposed in the 1950s, humans have explored the mastering of language intelligence by machine.. Language is essentially a complex, intricate system of human expressions governed by grammatical rules.

An overview of the theory is presented in Wolff and more detail may be found in earlier publications cited there. .

In this paper we approach the problem of defining machine intelligence as follows: Section 2 overviews well known theories, definitions and tests of intelligence that have been developed by psychologists.

Section 3 takes these key ideas an\n\n[8] 0712.3329v1.pdf (2007)\n. In the current paper we explore universal intelligence in much greater detail, in particular the way in which it relates to mainstream views on human intelligence and other proposed definitions of machine intelligence.

  "model_output": "Explainable AI (XAI) and Trustworthy AI (TAI) are related concepts that have evolved over time, with a focus on ensuring the transparency, accountability, and ethical use of AI systems. According to [1], in the context of Natural Language Generation (NLG), trustworthy AI necessitates understanding potential abuses of AI models and the development of measures to prevent them. The European Union's ethics guidelines for TAI emphasize the need to consider unintended or dual-use applications of AI systems and take steps to prevent abuse [1]. The foundational principles of XAI and TAI are rooted in the desire to create AI systems that are understandable, trustworthy, and transparent. This involves making the inner workings of these systems comprehensible to humans, which is crucial for building trust and ensuring ethical use [2]. Historically, the concept of Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark for assessing intelligence in machines. The test aims to determine if a machine's responses are indistinguishable from those of a human, and it has been a driving force in AI evolution since the 1950s [2]. However, with the advent of complex AI systems like Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI, there is a growing emphasis on understanding these systems' capabilities and limitations to ensure their ethical use [4][5]. As AI systems continue to evolve, there is an increasing need for XAI and TAI principles. This is particularly important as these systems are integrated into various aspects of society, where transparency, accountability, and ethical use become crucial for maintaining trust and avoiding misuse [1].
