Within the scope of AI, the Turing Test, a widely recognized test for assessing intelligence by discerning if responses are of human or machine origin, has been a longstanding objective in AI evolution. It is generally believed among researchers that a computing machine that successfully passes the Turing Test can be considered as intelligent. . Consequently, when viewed from a wider lens, the chronicle of AI can be depicted as the timeline of creation and evaluation of intelligent models and\n\n[2] 2303.18223v16.pdf (2025)\n. Abstract—Ever since the Turing Test was proposed in the 1950s, humans have explored the mastering of language intelligence by machine.. Language is essentially a complex, intricate system of human expressions governed by grammatical rules. It poses a significant challenge to develop capable artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language.\n\n[3] 0712.3329v1.pdf (2007)\n. We then examine some of the properties of universal intelligence, such as its ability to sensibly order simple learning algorithms and connections to the theory of universal optimal learning agents.. Section 4 overviews other definitions and tests of machine intelligence that have been proposed. Although surveys of the Turing test and its many variants exist, for example [SCA00], as far as we know this section is the first general survey of definitions and tests of machine intelligence. .

The system is Turing-equivalent in the sense that it can model the workings of a universal Turing machine but, unlike the universal Turing machine and equivalent models such as Lamda Calculus or Post's Canonical System, it has much more to say about the nature of 'intelligence' (Wolff, 1999a). The entire theory is based on principles of minimum length encoding pioneered by Ray Solomonoff and others (see Li and Vit´anyi ). . •\n\n[5] 2210.07321v4.pdf (2023)\n. Turing's proposed \"imitation game\" in 1950 considered the question of machine intelligence based on the ability of a machine to conduct human-like conversation over a text channel, for which the first widely-published method dates back to 1966 with the ELIZA chatbot.\n\n[3] 0712.3329v1.pdf (2007)\n. In this paper we approach the problem of defining machine intelligence as follows: Section 2 overviews well known theories, definitions and tests of intelligence that have been developed by psychologists. Our objective in this section is to gain an understanding of the essence of intelligence in the broadest possible terms. . In particular we are interested in commonly expressed ideas that could be applied to arbitrary systems and contexts, not just humans. . Section 3 takes these key ideas an\n\n[3] 0712.3329v1.pdf (2007)\n. We are particularly interested in common themes and general perspectives on intelligence that could be applicable to many kinds of systems, as these will form the foundation of our definition of machine intelligence in the next section.. children.

The SP theory is a new theory of computing and cognition developed with the aim of integrating and simplifying a range of concepts in computing and cognitive science, with a particular emphasis on concepts in artificial intelligence.

Simply determining whether a test, perhaps quite unintentionally, is partly a reflection of the race, gender, culture or social class of its creator is a subtle, complex and often politically charged issue.

We use our insights to construct a new model for word representation which we call GloVe, for Globa\n\n[3] 0712.3329v1.pdf (2007)\nIn this paper we approach this problem in the following way: We take a number of well known informal definitions of human intelligence that have been given by experts, and extract their essential features. These are then mathematically formalised to produce a general measure of intelligence for arbitrary machines. . We believe that this equation formally captures the concept of machine intelligence in the broadest reasonable sense. . We then show how this formal definition is related to the theo\n\n[8] N18-1202.pdf (2018)\n. We introduce a new type of deep contextualized word representation that models both (1) complex characteristics of word use (e.g., syntax and semantics), and (2) how these uses vary across linguistic contexts (i.e., to model polysemy). Our word vectors are learned functions of the internal states of a deep bidirectional language model (biLM), which is pretrained on a large text corpus.\n\n[6] 1910.10683v4.pdf (2023)\n. We also explore the limits of current approaches by scaling up the insights from our systematic study (training models up to 11 billion parameters) to obtain state-of-the-art results in many of the tasks we consider. In order to perform experiments at this scale, we introduce the \"Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus\" (C4), a data set consisting of hundreds of gigabytes of clean English text scraped from the web.\n\n[7] D14-1162.pdf (2014)\nOf course a large number of functions satisfy these properties, but one class of functions that we found to work well can be parameterized as, Because all unsupervised methods for learning word vectors are ultimately based on the occurrence statistics of a corpus, there should be commonalities between the models. Nevertheless, certain models remain somewhat opaque in this regard, particularly the recent window-based methods like skip-gram and ivLBL. . Therefore, in this subsection we show how th\n\n[3] 0712.3329v1.pdf (2007)\nTo measure the intelligence of such diverse systems in a meaningful way we must step back from the specifics of particular systems and establish the underlying fundamentals of what it is that we are really trying to measure. The difficulty of developing an abstract and highly general notion of intelligence is readily apparent. .

In some cases, a machine may display properties that we equate with human intelligence, in such cases it might be \"Innumerable tests are available for measuring intelligence, yet no one is quite certain of what intelligence is, or even just what it is that the available tests are measuring.\" — R. L. Gregory . [Gre98] reasonable to describe the machine as also being intelligent. . In other situations this view is far too limited and anthropocentric.\n\n[9] Expert_Systems.pdf (2016)\n. The general architecture of an expert system is presented in Figure 1 and its components are defined as follows (1): • User interface—the mechanism by which the user and the expert system communicate.. • Explanation facility—explains the reasoning of the system to a user. • Working memory—a database of facts used by the rules. . • Inference engine—makes inferences by deciding which rules are satisfied by facts or objects, prioritizes the satisfied rules, and executes the rule with the highest\n\n[3] 0712.3329v1.pdf (2007)\n. In the current paper we explore universal intelligence in much greater detail, in particular the way in which it relates to mainstream views on human intelligence and other proposed definitions of machine intelligence. Human intelligence is an enormously rich topic with a complex intellectual, social and political history. . For an overview the interested reader might want to consult \"Handbook of Intelligence\" .
