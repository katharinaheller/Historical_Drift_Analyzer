The SP theory is a new theory of computing and cognition developed with the aim of integrating and simplifying a range of concepts in computing and cognitive science, with a particular emphasis on concepts in artificial intelligence. An overview of the theory is presented in Wolff and more detail may be found in earlier publications cited there. . Amongst other things, the SP theory provides an attractive model for database applications, especially those requiring a measure of human-like 'inte\n\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\n. There is, of course, a wide variety of existing database systems that exhibit varying degrees and kinds of intelligence and it is reasonable to ask what may be gained by creating yet another system in that domain.. In brief, the attractions of the SP model in this connection are that: • It provides an extraordinarily simple yet versatile format for representing knowledge that facilitates the seamless integration of different kinds of knowledge. . The SP theory is an abstract model of any syste\n\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\n. The SP system should be able to organise its knowledge automatically in a way that minimises redundancies and reveals the natural structures in that knowledge, including class hierarchies, part-whole hierarchies and their integration. It should also be able to abstract rules and other generalisations from its stored knowledge, in the manner of datamining systems. . Of course, existing datamining techniques may also be applied to an SP database. . It would take us too far afield to attempt a de\n\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\nWithin the multiple alignment framework it is possible to represent knowledge in a format that is both simple and versatile, and processing within the framework provides a key to intelligence in the recognition of patterns, retrieval of information, probabilistic and exact kinds of reasoning, planning, problem solving and others. The versatility of the SP framework means that existing database models can be accommodated within the system and it can function in accordance with any one of those mo\n\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\n. Where the full versatility of this scheme is not needed, it is also possible to create networks and hierarchies from patterns like '... ', '... ' and '...

This section briefly reviews aspects of intelligence that have been shown to fall within the scope of the SP system, highlighting those with particular relevance to intelligent databases. . The main points of difference between the SP system and other artificial intell\n\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\n. In the development of the SP theory, computer models have been created as a way of reducing vagueness and inconsistencies in the theory, as a way of verifying that the system really does work according to expectations, and as a means of demonstrating what the system can do. Two main models have been developed to date: • SP61 which is a partial model of the system that builds multiple alignments from New and Old patterns (Wolff, 2000). . This model does not attempt any learning and it does not\n\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\n. It is true that this construct is not provided in most object-oriented database systems but it has been introduced in some artificial intelligence systems so that classes can be derived from metaclasses in the same way that objects are derived from classes. Of course, this logic points to the need for 'metametaclasses', 'metametametaclasses', and so on without limit. . Because the SP system makes no distinction between 'object' and 'class', there is no need for the concept of 'metaclass' or an\n\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\n. Chief amongst these is the remarkable simplicity of the system combined with its very wide scope, much wider than the great majority of artificial intelligence systems, with the possible exception of unified theories of cognition such as Soar (Laird et al., 1987; Rosenbloom et al., 1993) and ACT-R (Anderson and Lebiere, 1998). . Like those two systems, the development of the SP system was inspired by the writings of Allen Newell, putting the case for greater breadth and depth in theories of co\n\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\n. As noted previously, there is no reason why existing datamining techniques should not be used with an SP database although, in the long run, this kind of processing should fall within the scope of the SP model. The SP model is an alternative to existing database models that offers significant benefits compared with those models.\n\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\nIt provides a framework for processing that knowledge that integrates and simplifies a range of artificial intelligence functions including probabilistic and exact forms of reasoning, unsupervised learning, fuzzy pattern recognition, best-match information retrieval, planning, problem solving and others. Prototypes of the SP system have been developed as software simulations running on an ordinary computer. . These prototypes serve to demonstrate what can be done with the system and they provide\n\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\n. In its overall abstract structure, the SP system is conceived as a system for unsupervised learning—and capabilities in this area have now been demonstrated in the SP70 computer model (Wolff, 2003c, 2002b). The results are good enough to show that the approach is sound but further development is needed to realise the full potential of this model. . • Exact forms of reasoning.\n\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\n. The SP system provides a powerful framework for the representation and processing of ontologies and for the retrieval of information by meanings rather than literal matching of patterns (Wolff, 2003a).. •.

Non-syntactic 'semantic' structures may also be repr\n\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\nMeanwhile, there is no reason why an SP database system should not serve as a framework within which existing applications may be embedded, in much the same way that a relational or object-oriented database—or, indeed, an hierarchical file system—may contain pointers to executable files of many different kinds (see, for example, Cari˜no and Sterling ). •\n\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\n. In the database world, object-oriented concepts have been developed in the 'entity-relationship model' and the 'enhanced entity-relationship model' (see Connolly and Begg ) and also in a variety of 'object-oriented databases' (see Bertino et al. ). (In the remainder of this paper, the entity-relationship model and enhanced entity-relationship model will be referred to collectively as the entityrelationship model.) . In the SP system, all the object-oriented concepts mentioned in the previous p\n\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\n. The second main difference between the two models is that the relational model is designed purely for the storage and retrieval of knowledge while the SP model can, in addition, support a range of different kinds of intelligence, to be reviewed in Section 6.\n\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\nAlthough the hierarchical and network models for databases have fallen out of favour in ordinary data processing applications, the network model has seen a revival, first with the development of the hypertext concept and then more dramatically with the application of that concept to the world wide web. The hierarchical model is the mainstay of hierarchical file systems and finds niche applications in directories of various kinds. . In the SP system, any network or hierarchy can be represented us\n\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\nAlthough this may seem to be a very limited format, it is possible within the system to model a wide range of existing formats for knowledge, including context-free and context-sensitive grammars, condition-action rules, tables, networks and trees of various kinds, including class-inclusion hierarchies, partwhole-hierarchies and discrimination networks. Some examples will be seen below. . In the SP system, a symbol is simply a 'mark' that can be matched with other symbols to decide in each case\n\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\n. The SP system has been applied successfully to the problem of finding a route between two places (Wolff, 2003b) and it can solve geometric analogy problems translated into textual form (Wolff, 1999b). If this potential can be realised, this should reduce or eliminate the need for human judgement in the normalisation of knowledge structures.\n\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\n. A major strength of the SP system is its support for probabilistic 'deduction' in one step or via chains of reasoning, abductive reasoning, and nonmonotonic reasoning with default values (Wolff, 1999b).\n\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\n. The result is a conceptual framework with distinctive features of which the main ones are: The SP computer models (SP61 and SP70) are good enough to demonstrate what can be done with the system but fall short of what would be needed for applications in industry, commerce or administration. This section considers how the SP concepts that have been developed to date may be translated into a practical system.\n\nAnswer the refined query using only the context above. Use numeric citations.
