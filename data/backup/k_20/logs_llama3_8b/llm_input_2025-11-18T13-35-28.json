You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3.

Within the scope of AI, the Turing Test, a widely recognized test for assessing intelligence by discerning if responses are of human or machine origin, has been a longstanding objective in AI evolution.

The basic limitation currently, is to build expert systems with heuristic and empirical knowledge rather than deep knowledge, which include models of the functional and causal relations that underlie a problem. In the future, more systems might be developed using functional and causal models using a variety of representations. . Using multiple sources of knowledge (i.e., domain experts) in a cooperative manner is still a difficult problem waiting to be tackled.\n\n[1] 2210.07321v4.pdf (2023)\nGiven the strong generative capabilities of Transformer language models, and the corresponding increased risk of associated threat models, Transformer-based models rightly warrant particular emphasis in review.\n\n[1] 2210.07321v4.pdf (2023)\n.

(4) Review whether the analysis is accurate and complete: We have given careful thought to the presented threat models, which are formed from perspectives gained across industry, academia, and government. However, as threat modeling is an iterative process that benefits from diverse perspectives, we greatly encourage further analysis of potential attacks and mitigation measures in future research. . The remainder of this section comprises our threat model analysis, grouped according to a break\n\n[6] D14-1162.pdf (2014)\n. In this work we argue that the two classes of methods are not dramatically different at a fundamental level since they both probe the underlying co-occurrence statistics of the corpus, but the efficiency with which the count-based methods capture global statistics can be advantageous.\n\n[2] 3641289.pdf (2024)\nThis statement demonstrates that supervised models significantly outperform zero-shot models in terms of performance, highlighting that an increase in parameters does not necessarily guarantee a higher level of social knowledge in this particular scenario.. 3.1.2.

Third, the broad applicability of LLMs underscores the paramount importance of ensuring their safety and reliability, particularly in safety-sensitive sectors such as financial institutions and healthcare facilities. Finally, as LLMs are becoming larger with more emergent abilities, existing evaluation protocols may not be enough to evaluate their capabilities and potential risks.\n\n[7] 0712.3329v1.pdf (2007)\n. A fundamental problem in artificial intelligence is that nobody really knows what intelligence is.. The problem is especially acute when we need to consider artificial systems which are significantly different to humans.\n\n[1] 2210.07321v4.pdf (2023)\n. To summarize, the major contributions of this work are as follows: • The most complete survey of machine generated text detection to date, including previously omitted feature-based work and findings from recent contemporary research.. • The first detailed review of the threat models enabled by machine generated text, at a critical juncture where NLG models and tools are rapidly improving and proliferating. . • .
