Abstract—Ever since the Turing Test was proposed in the 1950s, humans have explored the mastering of language intelligence by machine.. Language is essentially a complex, intricate system of human expressions governed by grammatical rules. It poses a significant challenge to develop capable artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language.\n\n[6] 1304.1106v1.pdf (1990)\n. Although these results, in and of themselves, may not ap pear earth-shattering, they do highlight an im portant point: outsiders (i.e., people other than the system's designers) were able to investigate and experimentally validate a knowledge engi neering exercise. This type of experimentation is rare in AI and almost unheard of in knowl edge engineering; it was possible, in large part, because of the transparency of the Bayes net formalism. .

The technical evolution of LLMs has been making an important impact on the entire AI community, which would revolutionize the way how we develop and use AI algorithms. . Considering this rapid technical progress, in this survey, we review the recent advance\n\n[7] 0712.3329v1.pdf (2007)\n. In this paper we approach the problem of defining machine intelligence as follows: Section 2 overviews well known theories, definitions and tests of intelligence that have been developed by psychologists. Our objective in this section is to gain an understanding of the essence of intelligence in the broadest possible terms. . In particular we are interested in commonly expressed ideas that could be applied to arbitrary systems and contexts, not just humans. . Section 3 takes these key ideas an\n\n[4] 2210.07321v4.pdf (2023)\n. It may be difficult to differentiate those who mean to exploit such systems (e.g., thoughtlessly spam submissions to as many avenues as possible), and those who are relying on AI writing tools to better express themselves.\n\n[7] 0712.3329v1.pdf (2007)\nIn this paper we approach this problem in the following way: We take a number of well known informal definitions of human intelligence that have been given by experts, and extract their essential features. These are then mathematically formalised to produce a general measure of intelligence for arbitrary machines. . We believe that this equation formally captures the concept of machine intelligence in the broadest reasonable sense. . We then show how this formal definition is related to the theo\n\n[4] 2210.07321v4.pdf (2023)\n. To summarize, the major contributions of this work are as follows: • The most complete survey of machine generated text detection to date, including previously omitted feature-based work and findings from recent contemporary research.. • The first detailed review of the threat models enabled by machine generated text, at a critical juncture where NLG models and tools are rapidly improving and proliferating. . • .

In the current paper we explore universal intelligence in much greater detail, in particular the way in which it relates to mainstream views on human intelligence and other proposed definitions of machine intelligence.
