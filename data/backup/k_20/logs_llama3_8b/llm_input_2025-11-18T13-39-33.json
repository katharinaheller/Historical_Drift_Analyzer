If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3.

A popular speculation is that emergent abilities might be partially attributed to the evaluation setting for special tasks (e.g., the discontinuous evaluation metrics): when evaluation metrics are altered accordingly, the sharpness of the emergent ability curve would disappear.

Due to its great performance in handling different applications such as general natural language tasks and domain-specific ones, LLMs are increasingly used by individuals with critical information needs, such as students or patients.

Natural langu\n\n[2] 3641289.pdf (2024)\nWith the introduction of ChatGPT and GPT-4, there have been a number of research efforts aiming at evaluating ChatGPT and other LLMs from different aspects (Figure 2), encompassing a range of factors such as natural language tasks, reasoning, robustness, trustworthiness, medical applications, and ethical considerations. Despite these efforts, a comprehensive overview capturing the entire gamut of evaluations is still lacking.\n\n[2] 3641289.pdf (2024)\nTo address this, they transformed existing fact consistency tasks into binary labels, specifically considering only whether there is a factual conflict with the input text, without factoring in external knowledge. The research discovered that fact evaluation methods founded on natural language inference and question generation answering exhibit superior performance and can complement each other. . Pezeshkpour proposed a novel metric, based on information theory, to assess the inclusion of specif\n\n[2] 3641289.pdf (2024)\nIn the work of Honovich et al., they conducted a review of current factual consistency evaluation methods and highlighted the absence of a unified comparison framework and the limited reference value of related scores compared to binary labels.\n\n[5] 2303.18223v16.pdf (2025)\n. Furthermore, some capacities (e.g., in-context learning ) are unpredictable according to the scaling law, which can be observed only when the model size exceeds a certain level (as discussed below).. Emergent Abilities of LLMs.\n\n[3] 2201.05273v4.pdf (2022)\nFor example, Kryscinski et al. utilized a contextual network in the PLM decoder to retrieve the most salient parts from the source document to improve the level of faithfulness of generated summaries. Besides, several studies proposed to generate faithful texts by introducing additional losses besides the text generation loss. . Specifically, Yang et al. fine-tuned PLMs through a theme modeling loss which aims to make the generated summary semantically close to the original article for achieving\n\n[5] 2303.18223v16.pdf (2025)\n. For instance, end users prefer a reliable code generated by LLMs that can successfully pass the test case, but are less interested in selecting a better code with fewer errors between two failed ones. More recently, a study proposes a new evaluation setting that can enlarge the resolution of task metrics, making task performance more predictable. . Despite these efforts, more fundamental research (e.g., grokking10) about the working mechanism of LLMs is still in need to understand the emergenc\n\n[2] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n. Their evaluation expanded beyond the typical trustworthiness concerns to include eight critical aspects: toxicity, stereotype bias, adversarial and out-of-distribution robustness, robustness to adversarial demonstrations, privacy, machine ethics, and fairness.

They revealed that while GPT-4 often showcases improved trustworthiness over GPT-3.5 in standard evaluations, it is simultaneously more\n\n[2] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n. Furthermore, the ongoing evolution of LLMs has also presented novel aspects for evaluation, thereby challenging existing evaluation protocols and reinforcing the need for thorough, multifaceted evaluation techniques. While existing research such as Bubeck et al. claimed that GPT-4 can be seen as sparks of AGI, others contest this claim due to the human-crafted nature of its evaluation approach. .
