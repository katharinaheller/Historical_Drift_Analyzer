  "prompt_final_to_llm": "You are an analytical historian of Artificial Intelligence. Describe how the concept evolved across time, highlighting paradigm shifts, milestones, and key theoretical transformations. Present findings in a coherent historical narrative ordered strictly by explicit *event years* found in the snippets. If a snippet provides no explicit event year, you MUST write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'. Never guess or estimate historical periods under any circumstances. Avoid enumeration; emphasize causal relations and conceptual transitions. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nTrace the historical development and evolution of explain how data availability influenced ai methodologies across decades. strictly through the explicit event years present in the snippets.

Although it is widely acknowledged that much of human knowledge is uncertain, it is in the field of artificial intelligence that research on the representation and management of uncertainty in rule based reasoning has been focused (Kanal & Lemmer, 1986; Hink & Woods, 1987). Most of the work on uncertainty in artificial intelligence has so far been normative, stressing issues of mathematical correctness and effectiveness. . The approach taken in this paper is not normative, but descriptive. . I\n\n[2] 1304.1106v1.pdf (1990)\n. Although these results, in and of themselves, may not ap pear earth-shattering, they do highlight an im portant point: outsiders (i.e., people other than the system's designers) were able to investigate and experimentally validate a knowledge engi neering exercise.

The first proposed architecture is similar to the feedforward NNLM, where the non-linear hidden layer is removed and the projection layer is shared for all words (not just the projection matrix); thus, all words get projected into the same position (their vectors are averaged).
