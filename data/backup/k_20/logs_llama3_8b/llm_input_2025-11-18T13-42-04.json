Abstract—Ever since the Turing Test was proposed in the 1950s, humans have explored the mastering of language intelligence by machine.. Language is essentially a complex, intricate system of human expressions governed by grammatical rules. It poses a significant challenge to develop capable artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language.\n\n[6] 0712.3329v1.pdf (2007)\n. In the current paper we explore universal intelligence in much greater detail, in particular the way in which it relates to mainstream views on human intelligence and other proposed definitions of machine intelligence. Human intelligence is an enormously rich topic with a complex intellectual, social and political history. . For an overview the interested reader might want to consult \"Handbook of Intelligence\" .

It may be difficult to differentiate those who mean to exploit such systems (e.g., thoughtlessly spam submissions to as many avenues as possible), and those who are relying on AI writing tools to better express themselves.\n\n[8] 1304.1106v1.pdf (1990)\n. Although these results, in and of themselves, may not ap pear earth-shattering, they do highlight an im portant point: outsiders (i.e., people other than the system's designers) were able to investigate and experimentally validate a knowledge engi neering exercise. This type of experimentation is rare in AI and almost unheard of in knowl edge engineering; it was possible, in large part, because of the transparency of the Bayes net formalism. .

To summarize, the major contributions of this work are as follows: • The most complete survey of machine generated text detection to date, including previously omitted feature-based work and findings from recent contemporary research.. • The first detailed review of the threat models enabled by machine generated text, at a critical juncture where NLG models and tools are rapidly improving and proliferating. . • .

The general architecture of an expert system is presented in Figure 1 and its components are defined as follows (1): • User interface—the mechanism by which the user and the expert system communicate.. • Explanation facility—explains the reasoning of the system to a user. • Working memory—a database of facts used by the rules. . • Inference engine—makes inferences by deciding which rules are satisfied by facts or objects, prioritizes the satisfied rules, and executes the rule with the highest\n\n[9] 1304.1082v1.pdf (1990)\nThere is a vast literature on human judgment under uncertainty for very simple inference problems, typically with a single hypothesis variable and a single observation (e.g. see Kahneman et al., 1982 and Morgan & Henrion, 1990 for reviews), but relatively little is known about cognitive processes in more complex situations. To improve our insights into this and to seek inspiration for alternative approaches to explanation, we conducted a series of cognitive process-tracing studies. . We recorded\n\n[10] 1301.3781v3.pdf (2013)\nAs far as we know, none of the previously proposed architectures has been successfully trained on more than a few hundred of millions of words, with a modest dimensionality of the word vectors between 50 - 100.\n\n[6] 0712.3329v1.pdf (2007)\n. We then examine some of the properties of universal intelligence, such as its ability to sensibly order simple learning algorithms and connections to the theory of universal optimal learning agents..

Although surveys of the Turing test and its many variants exist, for example [SCA00], as far as we know this section is the first general survey of definitions and tests of machine intelligence. .

In the current paper we explore universal intelligence in much greater detail, in particular the way in which it relates to mainstream views on human intelligence and other proposed definitions of machine intelligence. Human intelligence is an enormously rich topic with a complex intellectual, social and political history. . For an overview the interested reader might want to consult \"Handbook of Intelligence\" .
