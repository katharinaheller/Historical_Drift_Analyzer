Never infer missing event years. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below.

You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3.

Chief amongst these is the remarkable simplicity of the system combined with its very wide scope, much wider than the great majority of artificial intelligence systems, with the possible exception of unified theories of cognition such as Soar (Laird et al., 1987; Rosenbloom et al., 1993) and ACT-R (Anderson and Lebiere, 1998). .

Since our goal is to produce interpretations of probabilistic reasoning that are more compatible with human reasoning styles, we started out with an empirical study of human strategies for uncertain reasoning. This provided us with the inspiration for the design of two new and contrasting modes of explaining probabilistic reasoning, namely qualitative belief propagation and scenario-based reasoning. .

This can·drastically simplify the explanation, since many real cases seem to be like the example above, where a few (two to four) scenarios turn out to have the bulk of the probability, and the vast mass can be ignored without significant error. Thirdly, in comparisons of the relative probability of pairs of scenarios, only those events with substantially different probabilities are mentioned. .
