By presenting a broad characterization of GPT-3's strengths and weaknesses, including these limitations, we hope to stimulate study of few-shot learning in language models and draw attention to where progress is most needed. A heuristic sense of the overall results can be seen in Figure 1.3, which aggregates the various tasks (though it should not be seen as a rigorous or meaningful benchmark in itself).\n\n[2] 1910.10683v4.pdf (2023)\nOur heuristics are inspired by past work on using Common Crawl as a source of data for NLP: For example, Grave et al. also filter text using an automatic language detector and discard short lines and Smith et al.;. Grave et al.. both perform line-level deduplication.\n\n[3] Expert_Systems.pdf (2016)\n. The basic limitation currently, is to build expert systems with heuristic and empirical knowledge rather than deep knowledge, which include models of the functional and causal relations that underlie a problem. In the future, more systems might be developed using functional and causal models using a variety of representations. . Using multiple sources of knowledge (i.e., domain experts) in a cooperative manner is still a difficult problem waiting to be tackled.\n\n[4] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\n. In current models, the main emphasis is on hill climbing and related techniques that concentrate search in areas that are proving productive without ruling out any part of the search space a priori—and with enough flexibility to be able to escape from 'local peaks'.\n\n[5] D14-1162.pdf (2014)\nThe statistics of word occurrences in a corpus is the primary source of information available to all unsupervised methods for learning word representations, and although many such methods now exist, the question still remains as to how meaning is generated from these statistics, and how the resulting word vectors might represent that meaning. In this section, we shed some light on this question. .

To address these issues, we used the following heuristics for cleaning up Common Crawl's web extracted text: • We only retained lines that ended in a terminal punctuation mark (i.e. a period, exclamation mark, question mark, or end quotation mark).. • We discarded any page with fewer than 3 sentences and only retained lines that contained at least 5 words. . • .

We introduce a new type of deep contextualized word representation that models both (1) complex characteristics of word use (e.g., syntax and semantics), and (2) how these uses vary across linguistic contexts (i.e., to model polysemy). Our word vectors are learned functions of the internal states of a deep bidirectional language model (biLM), which is pretrained on a large text corpus.\n\n[2] 1910.10683v4.pdf (2023)\nHowever, we opted to create a new data set because prior data sets use a more limited set of filtering heuristics, are not publicly available, and/or are different in scope (e.g. are limited to News data (Zellers et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019c), comprise only Creative Commons content, or are focused on parallel training data for machine translation ). .

By combining the insights from our exploration with scale and our new \"Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus\", we achieve state-of-the-art results on many benchmarks covering summarization, question answering, text classification, and more.\n\n[5] D14-1162.pdf (2014)\nOf course a large number of functions satisfy these properties, but one class of functions that we found to work well can be parameterized as, Because all unsupervised methods for learning word vectors are ultimately based on the occurrence statistics of a corpus, there should be commonalities between the models. Nevertheless, certain models remain somewhat opaque in this regard, particularly the recent window-based methods like skip-gram and ivLBL. . Therefore, in this subsection we show how th\n\n[2] 1910.10683v4.pdf (2023)\n. We also explore the limits of current approaches by scaling up the insights from our systematic study (training models up to 11 billion parameters) to obtain state-of-the-art results in many of the tasks we consider. In order to perform experiments at this scale, we introduce the \"Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus\" (C4), a data set consisting of hundreds of gigabytes of clean English text scraped from the web.\n\n[8] 2303.18223v16.pdf (2025)\n. As a remarkable contribution, the work in introduced the concept of distributed representation of words and built the word prediction function conditioned on the aggregated context features (i.e., the distributed word vectors).
