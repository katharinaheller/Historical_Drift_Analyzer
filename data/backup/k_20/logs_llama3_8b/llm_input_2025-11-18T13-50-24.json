Although it is widely acknowledged that much of human knowledge is uncertain, it is in the field of artificial intelligence that research on the representation and management of uncertainty in rule based reasoning has been focused (Kanal & Lemmer, 1986; Hink & Woods, 1987). Most of the work on uncertainty in artificial intelligence has so far been normative, stressing issues of mathematical correctness and effectiveness. . The approach taken in this paper is not normative, but descriptive. . I\n\n[2] 2210.07321v4.pdf (2023)\n. An alternative approach to purely rule-based approaches is to use an existing natural language corpus to generate rules for components of an NLG system, such as content selection or template generation. These statistical approaches are meant to be more adaptable to different domains than strictly rule-based systems. . While many different statistical models have been integrated with NLG systems in various ways, Hidden Markov Models (HMM) feature prominently in past work. . More recent non-neur\n\n[1] 1304.1083v1.pdf (1989)\n. A realistic way to simulate the data of human subjects in rule based propagation of uncertainty is to use maximin summarizing, multiplication scaling, and Beckerman's modified certainty factor model for combining evidence across rules.

The recent wave of work on Bayes nets, however, has suggested several diferent types of experiments: comparisons of different uncertainty formalisms, competi tions between Bayes nets and rule bases [14). [32), and several diferent approaches to (and motivations for) sensitivity analyses (29].

Even in a probabilistic setting, deterministic qualitative relations are likely to play a significant role in definitions, accounting relations, and constraints (for instance, in constrained opti mization problems. [Michelena and Agogino, 1989]). Conversely, the ability to express probabilistic re lationships in otherwise deterministic models adds veridicality, since real-world problems invariably present elements of uncertainty. .

In the context of knowledge-based systems, a benefit of this versatile 'universal' format for knowledge is the scope that it offers for the seamless integration of different kinds of knowledge, minimising the awkward incompatibilities that arise in many computing systems.. • Ontologies and 'semantic' retrieval of information.\n\n[3] 1304.1082v1.pdf (1990)\nThere is a vast literature on human judgment under uncertainty for very simple inference problems, typically with a single hypothesis variable and a single observation (e.g. see Kahneman et al., 1982 and Morgan & Henrion, 1990 for reviews), but relatively little is known about cognitive processes in more complex situations.

The SP system should be able to organise its knowledge automatically in a way that minimises redundancies and reveals the natural structures in that knowledge, including class hierarchies, part-whole hierarchies and their integration.
