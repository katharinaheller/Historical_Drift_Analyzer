Furthermore, InfiAgent-DABench (Hu et al. 2024) presents a end-to-end benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of data agents, the tasks require agents to end-to-end solving complex tasks by interacting with an execution environment.

When integrating contextual word embeddings with existing task-specific architectures, ELMo advances the state of the art for several major NLP benchmarks including question answering, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003).

Similar to ELMo, their model is feature-based and not deeply bidirectional. .\n\n[3] 1810.04805v2.pdf (2019)\n. More recently, sentence or document encoders which produce contextual token representations have been pre-trained from unlabeled text and fine-tuned for a supervised downstream task (Dai and Le, 2015; Howard and Ruder, 2018; Radford et al., 2018).

In addition to GLUE and SuperGLUE which are general language understanding evaluation benchmarks, an increasing number of general benchmarks targeted for text generation have recently been proposed.

Firstly, we provide an overview from the perspective of evaluation tasks, encompassing general natural language processing tasks, reasoning, medical usage, ethics, education, natural and social sciences, agent applications, and other areas. Secondly, we answer the 'where' and 'how' questions by diving into the evaluation methods and benchmarks, which serve as crucial components in assessing the performance of LLMs. . Then, we summarize the success and failure cases of LLMs in different tasks.\n\n[2] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n. NLG evaluates the capabilities of LLMs in generating specific texts, which consists of several tasks, including summarization, dialogue generation, machine translation, question answering, and other open-ended generation tasks. Evaluating the performance of LLMs on dialogue tasks is crucial to the development of dialogue systems and improving human-computer interaction.\n\n[5] NatureDeepReview.pdf (2025)\n. Although deep learning and simple reasoning have been used for speech and handwriting recognition for a long time, new paradigms are needed to replace rule-based manipulation of symbolic expressions by operations on large vectors101.. ■ Figure 5 | A recurrent neural network and the unfolding in time of the computation involved in its forward computation.\n\n[1] A Survey on Large Language Model-based Agents for Statistics and Data Science.pdf (2025)\n. The rise and potential of generative AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) or vision language models (VLMs) in the field of data science and analysis have gained increasing recognition in recent years.\n\n[1] A Survey on Large Language Model-based Agents for Statistics and Data Science.pdf (2025)\n. For example, DS-1000 (Lai et al. 2023) provides a large-scale benchmark of 1000 realistic problems spanning seven core Python data science libraries, with execution-based multi-criteria evaluation and mechanisms to reduce memorization bias. MLAgentBench (Huang et al. 2024a) introduces a benchmark focused on machine learning research workflows by constructing an LLM-agent pipeline.\n\n[6] 2303.18223v16.pdf (2025)\nRecently, the research on LLMs has been largely advanced by both academia and industry, and a remarkable progress is the launch of ChatGPT (a powerful AI chatbot developed based on LLMs), which has attracted widespread attention from society. The technical evolution of LLMs has been making an important impact on the entire AI community, which would revolutionize the way how we develop and use AI algorithms. . Considering this rapid technical progress, in this survey, we review the recent advance\n\n[6] 2303.18223v16.pdf (2025)\n. An empirical study from the OpenAI team has shown that representation quality or semantic content can still effectively improve even if approaching the point of diminishing returns (i.e., approaching the irreducible loss). This finding suggests that training large models are promising for improving the performance of downstream tasks. . To further explore scaling effect, a potential issue is that the amount of available data for training LLMs is actually limited. . With the ever-increasing mod\n\n[7] 2005.14165v4.pdf (2020)\n. There is evidence that suggests that the generalization achieved under this paradigm can be poor because the model is overly specific to the training distribution and does not generalize well outside it. [YdC+19, MPL19]. Thus, the performance of fine-tuned models on specific benchmarks, even when it is nominally at human-level, may exaggerate actual performance on the underlying task [GSL+18, NK19].\n\n[1] A Survey on Large Language Model-based Agents for Statistics and Data Science.pdf (2025)\n. In particular, planning and reasoning emphasize the generation of a logically structured sequence or roadmap of actions and thought processes to systematically address problems step by step (Huang et al. 2024b; Hong et al. 2024). Complex tasks often require a step-bystep approach to ensure effective resolution, while simpler tasks can be handled without such detailed breakdowns.\n\n[8] 1910.10683v4.pdf (2023)\n. This approach has recently been used to obtain state-of-the-art results in many of the most common NLP benchmarks (Devlin et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2019; Dong et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019c; Lan et al., 2019).\n\n[2] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n. A significant takeaway from previous attempts is the paramount importance of AI evaluation, which serves as a critical tool to identify current system limitations and inform the design of more powerful models. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have incited substantial interest across both academic and industrial domains. . As demonstrated by existing work, the great performance of LLMs has raised promise that they could be AGI in this era. .

By presenting a broad characterization of GPT-3's strengths and weaknesses, including these limitations, we hope to stimulate study of few-shot learning in language models and draw attention to where progress is most needed. A heuristic sense of the overall results can be seen in Figure 1.3, which aggregates the various tasks (though it should not be seen as a rigorous or meaningful benchmark in itself).\n\n[9] N18-1202.pdf (2018)\n.
