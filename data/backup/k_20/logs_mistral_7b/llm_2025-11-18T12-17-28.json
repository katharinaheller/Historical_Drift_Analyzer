Never infer missing event years. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nCompare and contrast the main theoretical perspectives on compare expert systems and neural network based systems in the corpus., grounding historical claims only in explicit snippet content.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] Expert_Systems.pdf (2016)\n.

Expert systems (ES) are knowledge-based systems that were one of the earlier research fields in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and can be defined as knowledgeintensive software that can perform some tasks normally requiring human expertise.

In this paper, we focus on distributed representations of words learned by neural networks, as it was previously shown that they perform significantly better than LSA for preserving linear regularities among words; LDA moreover becomes computationally very expensive on large data sets.

Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are extremely powerful machine learning models that achieve excellent performance on difficult problems such as speech recognition and visual object recognition.. DNNs are powerful because they can perform arbitrary parallel computation for a modest number of steps. A surprising example of the power of DNNs is their ability to sort N N-bit numbers using only 2 hidden layers of quadratic size. . So, while neural networks are related to conventional statistical models\n\n[1] Expert_Systems.pdf (2016)\n. The general architecture of an expert system is presented in Figure 1 and its components are defined as follows (1): • User interface—the mechanism by which the user and the expert system communicate.. • Explanation facility—explains the reasoning of the system to a user. • Working memory—a database of facts used by the rules. . • Inference engine—makes inferences by deciding which rules are satisfied by facts or objects, prioritizes the satisfied rules, and executes the rule with the highest\n\n[4] 1304.1082v1.pdf (1990)\n.

  "model_output": "Comparison of Expert Systems and Neural Network-Based Systems\n\nExpert systems, one of the earlier research fields in Artificial Intelligence (AI), were defined as knowledge-intensive software that can perform tasks requiring human expertise [1]. They emerged around mid-1970s under the umbrella of AI and have found applications in various areas such as engineering, chemistry, medicine, industry, etc. [1]. The general architecture of an expert system consists of a user interface, explanation facility, working memory, and inference engine [1]. On the other hand, neural networks were not explicitly mentioned as a separate field until the 2025 PDF [2], although they were used as part of some expert systems to perform classification tasks [1]. Neural network expert systems use inductive learning for handling empirical data and preventing the knowledge acquisition bottleneck [1]. Unlike expert systems that rely on IF–THEN rules, neural networks just use big activity vectors, big weight matrices, and scalar non-linearities to perform intuitive inference [2]. However, insufficient evidence is available to compare the development stages of these two approaches. While it is stated that expert systems have reached the maturity stage [1], there is no such statement for neural networks in the provided context. Additionally, while some commercial expert systems are mentioned [1], there is no mention of any commercially successful neural network-based systems.
