Within the scope of AI, the Turing Test, a widely recognized test for assessing intelligence by discerning if responses are of human or machine origin, has been a longstanding objective in AI evolution.

Abstract—Ever since the Turing Test was proposed in the 1950s, humans have explored the mastering of language intelligence by machine.. Language is essentially a complex, intricate system of human expressions governed by grammatical rules. It poses a significant challenge to develop capable artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language.\n\n[3] 2303.18223v16.pdf (2025)\nRecently, the research on LLMs has been largely advanced by both academia and industry, and a remarkable progress is the launch of ChatGPT (a powerful AI chatbot developed based on LLMs), which has attracted widespread attention from society. The technical evolution of LLMs has been making an important impact on the entire AI community, which would revolutionize the way how we develop and use AI algorithms. . Considering this rapid technical progress, in this survey, we review the recent advance\n\n[4] Expert_Systems.pdf (2016)\n. Expert systems (ES) are knowledge-based systems that were one of the earlier research fields in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and can be defined as knowledgeintensive software that can perform some tasks normally requiring human expertise.

In the current paper we explore universal intelligence in much greater detail, in particular the way in which it relates to mainstream views on human intelligence and other proposed definitions of machine intelligence.

  "model_output": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field that focuses on creating machine-based intelligence, replicating human-like problem-solving abilities. The Turing Test, proposed in the 1950s [3], serves as a benchmark for AI evaluation, assessing whether responses are of human or machine origin. Theoretical foundations of AI can be traced back to various definitions and tests of intelligence developed by psychologists [6]. For instance, Binet's test results were a good predictor of children's academic performance in the early 1900s [6]. In the 2000s, a universal intelligence measure was mathematically formalized to produce a general measure of intelligence for arbitrary machines [6]. Over time, the definition of AI has evolved to encompass different approaches and technologies. For example, Expert Systems were one of the earlier research fields in AI [4], while recent advancements involve Large Language Models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) [2]. The technical evolution of LLMs has been significant, with notable examples like ChatGPT [3]. However, it is crucial to address ethical considerations as AI continues to evolve. For instance, the EU Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI emphasize preventing and mitigating abuse of AI systems [5]. The imitation game proposed by Turing in 1950 considered the question of machine intelligence based on human-like conversation over a text channel [5].
