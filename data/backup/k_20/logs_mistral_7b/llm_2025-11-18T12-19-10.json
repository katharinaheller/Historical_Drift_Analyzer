Within the scope of AI, the Turing Test, a widely recognized test for assessing intelligence by discerning if responses are of human or machine origin, has been a longstanding objective in AI evolution.

Language is essentially a complex, intricate system of human expressions governed by grammatical rules. It poses a significant challenge to develop capable artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language.\n\n[9] 1304.1106v1.pdf (1990)\n. The recent wave of work on Bayes nets, however, has suggested several diferent types of experiments: comparisons of different uncertainty formalisms, competi tions between Bayes nets and rule bases [14). [32), and several diferent approaches to (and motivations for) sensitivity analyses (29]. For the most part, these studies ad dress the behavior of a system; although they are al system-specific, they should have some general implications to the way in which we approach system design. . Our re\n\n[1] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n. Due to its great performance in handling different applications such as general natural language tasks and domain-specific ones, LLMs are increasingly used by individuals with critical information needs, such as students or patients. Evaluation is of paramount prominence to the success of LLMs due to several reasons. . First, evaluating LLMs helps us better understand the strengths and weakness of LLMs. . For instance, the PromptBench benchmark illustrates that current LLMs are sensitive to ad\n\n[1] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n. Firstly, we provide an overview from the perspective of evaluation tasks, encompassing general natural language processing tasks, reasoning, medical usage, ethics, education, natural and social sciences, agent applications, and other areas. Secondly, we answer the 'where' and 'how' questions by diving into the evaluation methods and benchmarks, which serve as crucial components in assessing the performance of LLMs. . Then, we summarize the success and failure cases of LLMs in different tasks.\n\n[3] 2303.18223v16.pdf (2025)\n. A popular speculation is that emergent abilities might be partially attributed to the evaluation setting for special tasks (e.g., the discontinuous evaluation metrics): when evaluation metrics are altered accordingly, the sharpness of the emergent ability curve would disappear. However, the performance of LLMs on most tasks are perceived by users naturally in a discontinuous way.\n\n[1] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n. (2) Regarding what to evaluate, we summarize existing tasks in various areas and obtain insightful conclusions on the success and failure case of LLMs (Section 6), providing experience for future research. (3) As for where to evaluate, we summarize evaluation metrics, datasets, and benchmarks to provide a profound understanding of current LLMs evaluations. . In terms of how to evaluate, we explore current protocols and summarize novel evaluation approaches. . (4) We further discuss future chal\n\n[10] 2210.07321v4.pdf (2023)\n.

  "model_output": "The Turing Test, proposed in the 1950s [10], serves as a widely recognized test for assessing intelligence by distinguishing responses between human and machine origin. It is generally believed that a computing machine passing this test can be considered intelligent [3]. However, the Turing Test has limitations as it requires task-specific datasets and fine-tuning for strong performance on desired tasks [2]. Task performance evaluation serves as an alternative approach to assess AI capabilities. This approach can be traced back to Bayesian experiments in the 1990s [9] and count-based methods in the 2010s [7]. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have prompted a shift towards evaluating their performance across various tasks such as general natural language processing, reasoning, medical usage, ethics, education, natural and social sciences, agent applications, and others [1]. Existing research on LLMs reveals that they exhibit superior performance in handling diverse applications but also face limitations. For instance, current LLMs are sensitive to adversarial prompts [1], and their evaluation helps us better understand their strengths and weaknesses [1]. Furthermore, the evolution of LLMs has presented novel aspects for evaluation, challenging existing protocols and emphasizing the need for thorough, multifaceted evaluation techniques [1].
