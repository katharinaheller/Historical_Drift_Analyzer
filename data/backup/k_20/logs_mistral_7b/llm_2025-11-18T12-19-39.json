By presenting a broad characterization of GPT-3's strengths and weaknesses, including these limitations, we hope to stimulate study of few-shot learning in language models and draw attention to where progress is most needed.

LAMBDA facilitates an interactive analysis process, enabling us to perform tasks such as data processing, feature engineering, model training, parameter tuning, and evaluation through a series of guided conversations.

Aside from pointing to a conceptual limitation in our current NLP techniques, this adaptability has practical advantages – it allows humans to seamlessly mix together or switch between many tasks and skills, for example performing addition during a lengthy dialogue. To be broadly useful, we would someday like our NLP systems to have this same fluidity and generality.\n\n[3] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n. A significant takeaway from previous attempts is the paramount importance of AI evaluation, which serves as a critical tool to identify current system limitations and inform the design of more powerful models. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have incited substantial interest across both academic and industrial domains. . As demonstrated by existing work, the great performance of LLMs has raised promise that they could be AGI in this era. . LLMs possess the capabilities to solve diverse\n\n[3] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n. Firstly, we provide an overview from the perspective of evaluation tasks, encompassing general natural language processing tasks, reasoning, medical usage, ethics, education, natural and social sciences, agent applications, and other areas. Secondly, we answer the 'where' and 'how' questions by diving into the evaluation methods and benchmarks, which serve as crucial components in assessing the performance of LLMs. . Then, we summarize the success and failure cases of LLMs in different tasks.\n\n[7] D14-1162.pdf (2014)\n. In this work we argue that the two classes of methods are not dramatically different at a fundamental level since they both probe the underlying co-occurrence statistics of the corpus, but the efficiency with which the count-based methods capture global statistics can be advantageous.\n\n[3] 3641289.pdf (2024)\nWith the introduction of ChatGPT and GPT-4, there have been a number of research efforts aiming at evaluating ChatGPT and other LLMs from different aspects (Figure 2), encompassing a range of factors such as natural language tasks, reasoning, robustness, trustworthiness, medical applications, and ethical considerations. Despite these efforts, a comprehensive overview capturing the entire gamut of evaluations is still lacking.\n\n[3] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n. Furthermore, the ongoing evolution of LLMs has also presented novel aspects for evaluation, thereby challenging existing evaluation protocols and reinforcing the need for thorough, multifaceted evaluation techniques. While existing research such as Bubeck et al. claimed that GPT-4 can be seen as sparks of AGI, others contest this claim due to the human-crafted nature of its evaluation approach. . This paper serves as the first comprehensive survey on the evaluation of large language models. .\n\n[3] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n. (2) Regarding what to evaluate, we summarize existing tasks in various areas and obtain insightful conclusions on the success and failure case of LLMs (Section 6), providing experience for future research. (3) As for where to evaluate, we summarize evaluation metrics, datasets, and benchmarks to provide a profound understanding of current LLMs evaluations. . In terms of how to evaluate, we explore current protocols and summarize novel evaluation approaches. . (4) We further discuss future chal\n\n[3] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n. Through such evaluation, the natural language processing ability, context understanding ability and generation ability of the model can be improved, so as to realize a more intelligent and more natural dialogue system. Both Claude and ChatGPT generally achieve better performance across all dimensions when compared to GPT-3.5.\n\n[3] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n. Due to its great performance in handling different applications such as general natural language tasks and domain-specific ones, LLMs are increasingly used by individuals with critical information needs, such as students or patients. Evaluation is of paramount prominence to the success of LLMs due to several reasons. . First, evaluating LLMs helps us better understand the strengths and weakness of LLMs. . For instance, the PromptBench benchmark illustrates that current LLMs are sensitive to ad\n\n[6] 1910.10683v4.pdf (2023)\n. We also explore the limits of current approaches by scaling up the insights from our systematic study (training models up to 11 billion parameters) to obtain state-of-the-art results in many of the tasks we consider. In order to perform experiments at this scale, we introduce the \"Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus\" (C4), a data set consisting of hundreds of gigabytes of clean English text scraped from the web.\n\n[3] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n. The initial objective behind the development of language models, particularly large language models, was to enhance performance on natural language processing tasks, encompassing both understanding and generation. Consequently, the majority of evaluation research has been primarily focused on natural language tasks. . Table 2 summarizes the evaluation aspects of existing research, and we mainly highlight their conclusions in the following.2 3.1.1 Natural Language Understanding. . Natural langu\n\n[8] Expert_Systems.pdf (2016)\n. The basic limitation currently, is to build expert systems with heuristic and empirical knowledge rather than deep knowledge, which include models of the functional and causal relations that underlie a problem. In the future, more systems might be developed using functional and causal models using a variety of representations. . Using multiple sources of knowledge (i.e., domain experts) in a cooperative manner is still a difficult problem waiting to be tackled.\n\n[3] 3641289.pdf (2024)\nTo address this, they transformed existing fact consistency tasks into binary labels, specifically considering only whether there is a factual conflict with the input text, without factoring in external knowledge. The research discovered that fact evaluation methods founded on natural language inference and question generation answering exhibit superior performance and can complement each other. .

  "model_output": "The evaluation of human-like conversation in the corpus has been an area of interest for several researchers over time. Turing's proposed \"imitation game\" in 1950 ([2]) served as a starting point for this research, with the ELIZA chatbot being the first widely-published method for human-like conversation (described in [2]; year not stated). The evaluation methods have evolved over the years, focusing on various aspects such as natural language tasks, reasoning, and domain-specific applications ([3], 2024). Evaluating large language models (LLMs) helps us better understand their strengths and weaknesses, which is crucial for improving their performance and realizing more intelligent and natural dialogue systems ([3], 2024). One of the significant challenges in evaluating LLMs lies in handling adverse prompts that can lead to biased or misleading responses ([3], 2024). Some researchers have proposed evaluation metrics or correction methods to maintain factuality in generated texts ([5], 2022). In terms of natural language understanding, existing research has shown promising results, with natural language inference and question generation answering exhibiting superior performance ([3], 2024). However, evaluating the context understanding ability and generation ability of LLMs remains a crucial aspect for future research ([3], 2024).
