Abstract—Ever since the Turing Test was proposed in the 1950s, humans have explored the mastering of language intelligence by machine.. Language is essentially a complex, intricate system of human expressions governed by grammatical rules. It poses a significant challenge to develop capable artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language.\n\n[5] 2210.07321v4.pdf (2023)\n. It may be difficult to differentiate those who mean to exploit such systems (e.g., thoughtlessly spam submissions to as many avenues as possible), and those who are relying on AI writing tools to better express themselves.\n\n[5] 2210.07321v4.pdf (2023)\nAs such, trustworthy AI in the context of NLG necessitates understanding the areas where such models may be abused, and how these abuses may be prevented (either with detection technologies, moderation mechanisms, government legislation, or platform policies). When discussing attacks, we discuss not only the direct impact on targets, but also the broader impacts of both attacks and mitigation measures on trust.\n\n[7] 0712.3329v1.pdf (2007)\nIn this paper we approach this problem in the following way: We take a number of well known informal definitions of human intelligence that have been given by experts, and extract their essential features. These are then mathematically formalised to produce a general measure of intelligence for arbitrary machines. . We believe that this equation formally captures the concept of machine intelligence in the broadest reasonable sense. . We then show how this formal definition is related to the theo\n\n[5] 2210.07321v4.pdf (2023)\nThe EU ethics guidelines for trustworthy AI emphasize that unintended or dual-use applications of AI systems should be taken into account, and that steps should be taken to prevent and mitigate abuse of AI systems to cause harm.\n\n[7] 0712.3329v1.pdf (2007)\n. We then examine some of the properties of universal intelligence, such as its ability to sensibly order simple learning algorithms and connections to the theory of universal optimal learning agents..

Although surveys of the Turing test and its many variants exist, for example [SCA00], as far as we know this section is the first general survey of definitions and tests of machine intelligence. .

Although these results, in and of themselves, may not ap pear earth-shattering, they do highlight an im portant point: outsiders (i.e., people other than the system's designers) were able to investigate and experimentally validate a knowledge engi neering exercise.

The difficulty of developing an abstract and highly general notion of intelligence is readily apparent. .

While there has been much informal discussion of \"explaining away\" (a form of intercausal reasoning) (Henrion, 1986; Pearl, 1988), a precise characterization seems to be lacking of the general conditions under which explaining away or other qualitative intercausal reasoning applies.

In the current paper we explore universal intelligence in much greater detail, in particular the way in which it relates to mainstream views on human intelligence and other proposed definitions of machine intelligence.

The Turing Test, proposed in the 1950s [6], is a widely recognized test for assessing intelligence by discerning if responses are of human or machine origin. A machine that successfully passes this test can be considered as intelligent [6]. 2. Artificial Intelligence (AI) researchers focus on the development of machine-based intelligence, as opposed to human intelligence [1]. Authentic intelligence equips us with reasoning capabilities, enables us to test hypotheses, and prepares for future eventualities [1]. 3. Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant interest recently due to their great performance in diverse tasks. However, they possess limitations, as demonstrated by existing work [2]. 4. Supervised models significantly outperform zero-shot models in terms of performance [1]. Reasoning poses significant challenges for an intelligent AI model [1]. 5. The rise and potential of generative AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) or vision language models (VLMs), have gained increasing recognition in recent years [3]. 6. To measure the intelligence of diverse systems, we must establish the underlying fundamentals of what it is that we are trying to measure [7].
