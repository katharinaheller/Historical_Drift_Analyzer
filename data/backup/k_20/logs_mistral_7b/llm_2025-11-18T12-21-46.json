You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3.

Although it is widely acknowledged that much of human knowledge is uncertain, it is in the field of artificial intelligence that research on the representation and management of uncertainty in rule based reasoning has been focused (Kanal & Lemmer, 1986; Hink & Woods, 1987).

Within the scope of AI, the Turing Test, a widely recognized test for assessing intelligence by discerning if responses are of human or machine origin, has been a longstanding objective in AI evolution.

A significant takeaway from previous attempts is the paramount importance of AI evaluation, which serves as a critical tool to identify current system limitations and inform the design of more powerful models.

  "model_output": "The main theoretical perspectives on how AI concepts shifted from rule-based expert systems to modern approaches can be traced through several key events and developments, as described in the provided corpus. 1. Rule-Based Expert Systems (1970s - 2000s): Initially, AI research focused on developing knowledge-based expert systems (KES), which were designed to perform specific tasks requiring human expertise [2]. These KES utilized IF-THEN rules and employed inference engines for decision making. Examples of early KES include MYCIN, ACE, EURISKO, and SOPHIE [2]. The knowledge base was usually built by acquiring specialized domain knowledge from various sources such as books, periodicals, or interviews with human experts [2]. In the 1980s, efforts were made to overcome the limitations of KES due to a knowledge acquisition bottleneck. Inductive learning and neural networks (connectionist expert systems) were employed for knowledge representation [2]. In the case of neural network expert systems, connection weights served as the knowledge base [2]. 1. Evaluation of Rule-Based Systems: Researchers investigated the performance and limitations of rule-based systems by comparing different uncertainty formalisms, competitions between Bayesian networks and rule bases, and sensitivity analyses [4]. However, it was acknowledged that these systems were not effective descriptive models for human reasoning under uncertainty [3]. 1. Shift towards Modern Approaches: As the corpus shows, the early 2000s marked a transition from rule-based approaches to newer methods, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) or vision language models (VLMs), which gained prominence in recent years [6]. These modern approaches are inspired by advances in statistical modeling and machine learning. For example, non-neural models were used to accomplish natural language generation (NLG) tasks before the rise of neural networks [1]. However, the corpus lacks evidence regarding when or how precisely this shift occurred from rule-based approaches to modern methods like LLMs. References:\n[1] 2210.07321v4.pdf (2023)\n[2] Expert_Systems.pdf (2016)\n[3] 1304.1082v1.pdf (1990)\n[4] 1304.1106v1.pdf (1990)\n[5] 1304.1083v1.pdf (1989)\n[6] A Survey on Large Language Model-based Agents for Statistics and Data Science.pdf (2025)"
