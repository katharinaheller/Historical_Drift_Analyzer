You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4.

Abstract—Ever since the Turing Test was proposed in the 1950s, humans have explored the mastering of language intelligence by machine.. Language is essentially a complex, intricate system of human expressions governed by grammatical rules. It poses a significant challenge to develop capable artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language.\n\n[1] 0712.3329v1.pdf (2007)\n. In some cases, a machine may display properties that we equate with human intelligence, in such cases it might be \"Innumerable tests are available for measuring intelligence, yet no one is quite certain of what intelligence is, or even just what it is that the available tests are measuring.\" — R. L. Gregory . [Gre98] reasonable to describe the machine as also being intelligent. . In other situations this view is far too limited and anthropocentric.\n\n[7] 2210.07321v4.pdf (2023)\n.

  "model_output": "The main theoretical perspectives on general intelligence and narrow AI can be compared as follows:\n\n1. General Intelligence (also known as artificial general intelligence, AGI):\n   - AGI refers to machines that have the ability to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can do [1]. - The Turing Test, proposed in 1950, is a widely recognized benchmark for assessing whether a machine has achieved AGI by discerning if responses are of human or machine origin [2, 7]. - The issue of defining and measuring general intelligence is complex, particularly when considering artificial systems that differ significantly from humans [1]. 2. Narrow AI:\n   - Also known as Weak AI, it refers to machines that are designed to perform a specific task (e.g., voice recognition or driving a car) [1]. - Terman's intelligence test for children in the 1900s is an example of narrow AI, as it was specifically designed to measure certain aspects of human cognitive abilities [1]. - Modern applications of Narrow AI include text summarization and question answering [3, 5, 6]. In terms of historical context:\n- The Turing Test was proposed in 1950 [7], and the first widely-published method for conducting it dates back to 1966 with the ELIZA chatbot [7]. - Terman's intelligence test for children was developed in the 1900s [1]. - The problem of defining machine intelligence as a whole has been addressed since at least 2007, when the paper \"Universal Machine Intelligence: Measuring and Achieving Correct Reasoning\" was published [1].
