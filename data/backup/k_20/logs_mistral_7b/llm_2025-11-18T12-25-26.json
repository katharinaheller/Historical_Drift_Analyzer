Exact Bayesian inference to find the posterior probability of an event can be performed by looking at the ratio of the sum of the probabilities of all scenarios compatible with the event to the sum of all those not compatible, after eliminating all scenarios not consistent with the observations.

Since our goal is to produce interpretations of probabilistic reasoning that are more compatible with human reasoning styles, we started out with an empirical study of human strategies for uncertain reasoning.

  "model_output": "**Artificial Intelligence and Bayesian Networks**\n\nBayesian networks, also known as belief networks or influence diagrams, are a fundamental concept in AI that provide a graphical representation of complex probabilistic relationships among variables [10] (1990). These networks aim to represent qualitative probabilistic information in a perspicuous manner [1] (1990). The theoretical foundations of Bayesian networks lie in probability theory and graph theory. A Bayesian network is a directed acyclic graph consisting of nodes representing random variables and edges indicating their probabilistic dependencies [10] (1990). The key aspect of these networks is the ability to perform probabilistic inference, which involves calculating conditional probabilities based on the structure and parameters of the network. The historical role of Bayesian networks in AI reasoning can be traced back to the 1980s and 1990s. During this period, there was a growing interest in developing AI systems capable of reasoning under uncertainty. Expert systems, one of the earlier research fields in AI, made use of knowledge engineering techniques, such as Bayesian networks, to perform specific domain problems [5] (2016). In 1989, researchers presented an approach to reasoning under uncertainty called certainty factors, which could be considered Bayesian under restricted assumptions. However, they criticized this method for not making full use of a Bayesian analysis [3]. By the 1990s, there was increased focus on providing comprehensible explanations of probabilistic reasoning to improve the acceptance of Bayesian methods in expert systems and decision support systems [1] (1990). The development of Bayesian networks continued through the 2000s, with researchers focusing on improving their efficiency and applicability. For example, works from 2001 discussed the importance of understanding the essentials of what is going on by examining only a subset of scenarios [1] (1990). In recent years, Bayesian networks have been applied in various AI applications, such as large language models and vision-language models, which are gaining recognition for their capabilities in data science and analysis [8] (2025) and [9] (2025). Moreover, the rise of generative AI, particularly Large Language Models, has led to a significant focus on understanding the essence of intelligence and establishing whether a machine embodies it [2] (2024). **References**\n[1] 1304.1082v1.pdf (1990)\n[2] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n[3] 1304.1083v1.pdf (1989)\n[4] 1301.2254v1.pdf (2001)\n[5] Expert_Systems.pdf (2016)\n[6] NatureDeepReview.pdf (2025)\n[7] 1304.1106v1.pdf (1990)\n[8] 2303.18223v16.pdf (2025)\n[9] A Survey on Large Language Model-based Agents for Statistics and Data Science.pdf (2025)\n[10] 1304.1081v1.pdf (1990)"
