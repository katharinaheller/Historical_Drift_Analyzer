Provide a precise definition, clarify theoretical foundations, and explain how interpretations evolved across time and publications. Use event years ONLY if explicitly stated in the snippets. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6.

After expert systems have moved out of research laboratories during early 1980s, they became more popular and found several application fields such as engineering, chemistry, medicine, industry, and many others.

Other approaches for learning contextual embeddings include the pivot word itself in the representation and are computed with the encoder of either a supervised neural machine translation (MT) system (CoVe; McCann et al., 2017) or an unsupervised language model. Both of these approaches benefit from large datasets, although the MT approach is limited by the size of parallel corpora. . In this paper, we take full advantage of access to plentiful monolingual data, and train our biLM on a corpus\n\n[3] 1910.10683v4.pdf (2023)\n. We also explore the limits of current approaches by scaling up the insights from our systematic study (training models up to 11 billion parameters) to obtain state-of-the-art results in many of the tasks we consider.

An alternative approach to purely rule-based approaches is to use an existing natural language corpus to generate rules for components of an NLG system, such as content selection or template generation.

As a major approach, language modeling has been widely studied for language understanding and generation in the past two decades, evolving from statistical language models to neural language models.\n\n[6] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\n. In its overall abstract structure, the SP system is conceived as a system for unsupervised learning—and capabilities in this area have now been demonstrated in the SP70 computer model (Wolff, 2003c, 2002b). The results are good enough to show that the approach is sound but further development is needed to realise the full potential of this model. . • Exact forms of reasoning.\n\n[3] 1910.10683v4.pdf (2023)\n. To summarize, our model is roughly equivalent to the original Transformer proposed by Vaswani et al. with the exception of removing the Layer Norm bias, placing the layer normalization outside the residual path, and using a different position embedding scheme. Since these architectural changes are orthogonal to the experimental factors we consider in our empirical survey of transfer learning, we leave the ablation of their impact for future work. . As part of our study, we experiment with the\n\n[8] 2303.18223v16.pdf (2025)\nAnother large-scale book corpus is Project Gutenberg, consisting of over 70,000 literary books including novels, essays, poetry, drama, history, science, philosophy, and other types of works in the public domain. It is currently one of the largest open-source book collections, which is used in training of MT-NLG and LLaMA. . As for Mixed Data. . In addition to the aforementioned specific types of datasets, different types of data have been combined to facilitate usage by researchers.\n\n[9] 1706.03762v7.pdf (2024)\n. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations.\n\n[3] 1910.10683v4.pdf (2023)\n. For example, a historically common approach is to use word vectors (Mikolov et al., 2013b,a; Pennington et al., 2014) to map word identities to a continuous representation where, ideally, similar words map to similar vectors. These vectors are often learned through an objective that, for example, encourages co-occurring words to be positioned nearby in the continuous space. . Recently, it has become increasingly common to pre-train the entire model on a data-rich task. . Ideally, this pre-trai\n\n[10] D14-1162.pdf (2014)\nThe statistics of word occurrences in a corpus is the primary source of information available to all unsupervised methods for learning word representations, and although many such methods now exist, the question still remains as to how meaning is generated from these statistics, and how the resulting word vectors might represent that meaning. In this section, we shed some light on this question. . We use our insights to construct a new model for word representation which we call GloVe, for Globa\n\n[7] 2210.07321v4.pdf (2023)\nHowever, as mentioned in Section 1.2, consideration of the broader field of natural language generation and previous detection research is important as detection techniques that apply against pre-Transformer models have been shown to be useful in detection of modern generative models, and diverse approaches may offer increased adversarial robustness or better explainability. 2.3 Natural Language Generation Approaches There are a wide range of model architectures and algorithmic approaches to nat\n\n[6] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\n. The SP system has been applied successfully to the problem of finding a route between two places (Wolff, 2003b) and it can solve geometric analogy problems translated into textual form (Wolff, 1999b). If this potential can be realised, this should reduce or eliminate the need for human judgement in the normalisation of knowledge structures.\n\n[4] N18-1202.pdf (2018)\n. We introduce a new type of deep contextualized word representation that models both (1) complex characteristics of word use (e.g., syntax and semantics), and (2) how these uses vary across linguistic contexts (i.e., to model polysemy). Our word vectors are learned functions of the internal states of a deep bidirectional language model (biLM), which is pretrained on a large text corpus.\n\nAnswer the refined query using only the context above.

  "model_output": "Knowledge acquisition approaches, also known as knowledge engineering, have evolved over time with the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI). These approaches involve acquiring knowledge from various sources such as periodicals, books, and domain experts [2]. Theoretical foundations of knowledge acquisition are rooted in expert systems, which gained popularity in the early 1980s. Expert systems were designed to solve complex problems by emulating human expertise [2]. One of the key concepts in this field is the 'universal' format for knowledge integration, offering a scope for seamless integration of different types of knowledge [6]. Historically, rule-based and statistical approaches have been used for natural language generation (NLG). Rule-based systems were initially popular, but later, statistical models like Hidden Markov Models (HMM) gained prominence. More recently, neural language models (NLMs) have emerged as a major approach [7]. The definition of text summarization includes extractive and abstractive methods that condense text into brief summaries while retaining key information from the source text [1]. Over time, methods like multi-task fine-tuning and pre-training large models on extensive corpora have improved the performance of text summarization systems [1, 3, 4]. Word representation learning, another crucial aspect in AI, has transitioned from statistical word vector models to deep contextualized representations. Notable examples include GloVe [10] and bidirectional language models (biLM) [4]. In terms of evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs), approaches focus on summarizing existing tasks, evaluation metrics, datasets, and benchmarks [5]. Understanding the successes and failures of LLMs provides insights for future research [5].
