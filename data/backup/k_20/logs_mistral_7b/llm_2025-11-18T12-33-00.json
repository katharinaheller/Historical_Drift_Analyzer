  "model_output": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) involves the development of machine-based intelligence, focusing on reasoning capabilities and hypothesis testing to prepare for future eventualities [3]. Symbolic representation enables inference in AI by allowing machines to manipulate internal symbolic expressions using rules, as demonstrated by expert systems [7]. This approach is based on a knowledge base, an inference engine, and a user interface [7]. Theoretical foundations of symbolic representation include qualitative belief propagation, tracing the qualitative effect of evidence through a belief network from one variable to the next [4]. This algorithm serves as an alternative to graph reduction algorithms for inference in qualitative probabilistic networks [4]. Historically, the Turing Test has played a significant role in AI evolution, serving as a benchmark for assessing intelligence by discerning if responses are of human or machine origin since the 1950s (described in 2025 PDF [7]). Inference schemes using propagation operate on a belief network representation of knowledge, while scenario-based explanations are based on scenario trees [4]. The evolution of interpretations across publications has shifted focus from rule-based manipulation of symbolic expressions to deep learning and large vectors, such as recurrent neural networks (RNN) [1] and deep contextualized word representations [8]. However, there is still ongoing research into improving the performance and capabilities of AI systems, particularly with the rise of large language models (LLMs) [3, 9].
