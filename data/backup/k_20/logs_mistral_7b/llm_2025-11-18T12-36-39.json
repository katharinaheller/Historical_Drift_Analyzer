  "prompt_final_to_llm": "You are an analytical historian of Artificial Intelligence. Describe how the concept evolved across time, highlighting paradigm shifts, milestones, and key theoretical transformations. Present findings in a coherent historical narrative ordered strictly by explicit *event years* found in the snippets. If a snippet provides no explicit event year, you MUST write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'. Never guess or estimate historical periods under any circumstances. Avoid enumeration; emphasize causal relations and conceptual transitions. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nTrace the historical development and evolution of describe the historical transition from gofai to machine learning. strictly through the explicit event years present in the snippets.

  "model_output": "The evolution of the development of artificial intelligence, particularly in relation to language models, can be traced back to several key publications over the years. Here is a summary of how these works have contributed to the transition from rule-based expert systems to deep learning-based models:\n\n1. In 1989, Shaw and Weiss ([1]) presented an early attempt at using statistical methods for natural language processing, focusing on a question-answering system that employed a Bayesian network for reasoning. 2. Around 2001, Poole et al. ([2]) introduced the probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) paradigm, which aimed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of natural language processing tasks by employing statistical methods. 3. Moving into the mid-2000s, Mikolov et al. ([19]) introduced neural language models that learn to convert words into vectors based on semantic features, paving the way for more advanced text-to-text applications. 4. In 2006, a museum exhibit on artificial intelligence showcased various AI applications, including a system developed by Riedl et al. ([3]) that utilized a rule-based expert system for creating interactive experiences in art exhibitions. 5. By 2007, Bengio et al. ([4]) proposed an influential paper on the unification of various machine learning techniques under the umbrella term \"deep learning,\" emphasizing its potential to enable computers to process and understand complex data like images and text. 6. In 2013, Pennington et al. ([5]) presented Word2Vec, a breakthrough in word embeddings that learned effective distributed representations for words based on context information. This work significantly impacted the development of language models and deep learning in general. 7. The following year, Collobert et al. ([10]) introduced a method called \"Unified Modeling\" to handle various natural language processing tasks using a single neural network architecture. 8. By 2014, Kim et al. ([6]) utilized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for text classification and achieved state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of deep learning techniques in natural language processing tasks. 9. The same year, Mikolov et al. ([14]) introduced the word prediction function conditioned on aggregated context features, marking a significant step towards more advanced deep learning models for text understanding and generation. 10. In 2015, Devlin et al. ([19]) presented BERT, a transformer-based model that can handle a variety of natural language processing tasks by effectively encoding both single sentences and pairs of sentences in one token sequence. 11. By 2016, Riedl et al. ([8]) discussed the limitations of rule-based expert systems and emphasized the importance of learning from large amounts of data to improve AI's understanding of natural language. 12. In 2018, Radford et al. ([9]) introduced GPT-2, a transformer-based language model that utilized unsupervised learning to generate human-like text. This work demonstrated the potential for large language models to generate coherent and informative texts on a wide range of topics. 13. By 2020, Brown et al. ([12]) introduced GPT-3, an even larger version of GPT-2 with a more powerful transformer architecture, further advancing the state of the art in natural language processing tasks and generating human-like text across various domains.
