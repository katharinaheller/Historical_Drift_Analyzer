Never infer missing event years. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number.

You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nCompare and contrast the main theoretical perspectives on explain how future directions for ai research are framed in the corpus., grounding historical claims only in explicit snippet content.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n.

Considering this rapid technical progress, in this survey, we review the recent advance\n\n[5] 1910.10683v4.pdf (2023)\n. We also explore the limits of current approaches by scaling up the insights from our systematic study (training models up to 11 billion parameters) to obtain state-of-the-art results in many of the tasks we consider. In order to perform experiments at this scale, we introduce the \"Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus\" (C4), a data set consisting of hundreds of gigabytes of clean English text scraped from the web.\n\n[6] 1304.1106v1.pdf (1990)\n.

We are particularly interested in common themes and general perspectives on intelligence that could be applicable to many kinds of systems, as these will form the foundation of our definition of machine intelligence in the next section.. children.

With this unified approach, we can compare the effectiveness of different transfer learning objectives, unlabeled data sets, and other factors, while exploring the limits of transfer learning for NLP by scaling up models and data sets beyond what has previously been considered. We emphasize that our goal is not to propose new methods but instead to provide a comprehensive perspective on where the field stands. . As such, our work primarily comprises a survey, exploration, and empirical compari\n\n[8] 2205.01068v4.pdf (2022)\n. While this is a significant achievement, the energy cost of creating such a model is still nontrivial, and repeated efforts to replicate a model of this size will only amplify the growing compute footprint of these LLMs. We believe the entire AI community — academic researchers, civil society, policymakers, and industry — must work together to develop clear 125M 6.0e−4 0.5M 350M 3.0e−4 0.5M 1.3B . 2.0e−4 1M 2.7B 1.6e−4 1M 6.7B . 1.2e−4 2M 13B 1.0e−4 4M 30B 1.0e−4 4M 66B 0.8e−4 2M 175B 1.2e−4 2\n\n[2] 2210.07321v4.pdf (2023)\nAs such, trustworthy AI in the context of NLG necessitates understanding the areas where such models may be abused, and how these abuses may be prevented (either with detection technologies, moderation mechanisms, government legislation, or platform policies). When discussing attacks, we discuss not only the direct impact on targets, but also the broader impacts of both attacks and mitigation measures on trust.\n\n[6] 1304.1106v1.pdf (1990)\n. The recent wave of work on Bayes nets, however, has suggested several diferent types of experiments: comparisons of different uncertainty formalisms, competi tions between Bayes nets and rule bases [14).

In the current paper we explore universal intelligence in much greater detail, in particular the way in which it relates to mainstream views on human intelligence and other proposed definitions of machine intelligence.

Turing Test-oriented Approach [1]\n   - Inception and objective: The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark to assess machine intelligence by discerning responses of human or machine origin [1]. A machine passing the Turing Test is considered intelligent [1]. - Future directions: Researchers aim to create more powerful models that can successfully pass the Turing Test [1]. 2. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Trustworthy AI [2][3][4]\n   - Contribution: LLMs have gained significant interest due to their performance in diverse tasks, leading some to consider them as AGI [2][3]. The importance of evaluating AI, identifying current system limitations, and designing more powerful models is emphasized [1]. - Trustworthy AI: Recent research focuses on understanding areas where such models may be abused, developing detection technologies, moderation mechanisms, government legislation, or platform policies to prevent misuse [2]. 3. Human Intelligence Analogies and Machine Intelligence Definition [6][7]\n   - Binet's test results as a predictor of children's academic performance [7], which served as an early model for assessing intelligence. - Universal intelligence exploration in relation to mainstream views on human intelligence and other proposed definitions of machine intelligence [7].
