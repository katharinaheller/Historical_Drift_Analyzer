Abstract—Ever since the Turing Test was proposed in the 1950s, humans have explored the mastering of language intelligence by machine.. Language is essentially a complex, intricate system of human expressions governed by grammatical rules. It poses a significant challenge to develop capable artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language.\n\n[5] 0712.3329v1.pdf (2007)\n. In this paper we approach the problem of defining machine intelligence as follows: Section 2 overviews well known theories, definitions and tests of intelligence that have been developed by psychologists. Our objective in this section is to gain an understanding of the essence of intelligence in the broadest possible terms. . In particular we are interested in commonly expressed ideas that could be applied to arbitrary systems and contexts, not just humans. . Section 3 takes these key ideas an\n\n[6] 2210.07321v4.pdf (2023)\nAs such, trustworthy AI in the context of NLG necessitates understanding the areas where such models may be abused, and how these abuses may be prevented (either with detection technologies, moderation mechanisms, government legislation, or platform policies). When discussing attacks, we discuss not only the direct impact on targets, but also the broader impacts of both attacks and mitigation measures on trust.\n\n[6] 2210.07321v4.pdf (2023)\n. It may be difficult to differentiate those who mean to exploit such systems (e.g., thoughtlessly spam submissions to as many avenues as possible), and those who are relying on AI writing tools to better express themselves.\n\n[5] 0712.3329v1.pdf (2007)\n. In the current paper we explore universal intelligence in much greater detail, in particular the way in which it relates to mainstream views on human intelligence and other proposed definitions of machine intelligence.
