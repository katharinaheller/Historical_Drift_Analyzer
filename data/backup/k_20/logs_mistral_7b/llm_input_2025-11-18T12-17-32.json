The SP theory is a new theory of computing and cognition developed with the aim of integrating and simplifying a range of concepts in computing and cognitive science, with a particular emphasis on concepts in artificial intelligence. An overview of the theory is presented in Wolff and more detail may be found in earlier publications cited there. . Amongst other things, the SP theory provides an attractive model for database applications, especially those requiring a measure of human-like 'inte\n\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\n. In the development of the SP theory, computer models have been created as a way of reducing vagueness and inconsistencies in the theory, as a way of verifying that the system really does work according to expectations, and as a means of demonstrating what the system can do. Two main models have been developed to date: • SP61 which is a partial model of the system that builds multiple alignments from New and Old patterns (Wolff, 2000). . This model does not attempt any learning and it does not\n\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\n. There is, of course, a wide variety of existing database systems that exhibit varying degrees and kinds of intelligence and it is reasonable to ask what may be gained by creating yet another system in that domain.. In brief, the attractions of the SP model in this connection are that: • It provides an extraordinarily simple yet versatile format for representing knowledge that facilitates the seamless integration of different kinds of knowledge. . The SP theory is an abstract model of any syste\n\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\n. Chief amongst these is the remarkable simplicity of the system combined with its very wide scope, much wider than the great majority of artificial intelligence systems, with the possible exception of unified theories of cognition such as Soar (Laird et al., 1987; Rosenbloom et al., 1993) and ACT-R (Anderson and Lebiere, 1998). . Like those two systems, the development of the SP system was inspired by the writings of Allen Newell, putting the case for greater breadth and depth in theories of co\n\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\n. In its overall abstract structure, the SP system is conceived as a system for unsupervised learning—and capabilities in this area have now been demonstrated in the SP70 computer model (Wolff, 2003c, 2002b). The results are good enough to show that the approach is sound but further development is needed to realise the full potential of this model. . • Exact forms of reasoning.\n\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\nIt provides a framework for processing that knowledge that integrates and simplifies a range of artificial intelligence functions including probabilistic and exact forms of reasoning, unsupervised learning, fuzzy pattern recognition, best-match information retrieval, planning, problem solving and others.

These prototypes serve to demonstrate what can be done with the system and they provide\n\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\n. A major strength of the SP system is its support for probabilistic 'deduction' in one step or via chains of reasoning, abductive reasoning, and nonmonotonic reasoning with default values (Wolff, 1999b).\n\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\n. The SP system has been applied successfully to the problem of finding a route between two places (Wolff, 2003b) and it can solve geometric analogy problems translated into textual form (Wolff, 1999b). If this potential can be realised, this should reduce or eliminate the need for human judgement in the normalisation of knowledge structures.\n\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\n. The SP system provides a powerful framework for the representation and processing of ontologies and for the retrieval of information by meanings rather than literal matching of patterns (Wolff, 2003a).. •.

Of course, existing datamining techniques may also be applied to an SP database. . It would take us too far afield to attempt a de\n\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\n. The result is a conceptual framework with distinctive features of which the main ones are: The SP computer models (SP61 and SP70) are good enough to demonstrate what can be done with the system but fall short of what would be needed for applications in industry, commerce or administration. This section considers how the SP concepts that have been developed to date may be translated into a practical system.\n\n[2] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n. Within the scope of AI, the Turing Test, a widely recognized test for assessing intelligence by discerning if responses are of human or machine origin, has been a longstanding objective in AI evolution. It is generally believed among researchers that a computing machine that successfully passes the Turing Test can be considered as intelligent. . Consequently, when viewed from a wider lens, the chronicle of AI can be depicted as the timeline of creation and evaluation of intelligent models and\n\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\n. Although this area is less well developed, there are good reasons to think that the SP system may also be applied to the 'exact' kinds of reasoning found in many areas of logic and mathematics, where answers are either 'true' or 'false', with nothing in between (Wolff, 2002a).. • Planning and problem solving.\n\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\n. Although in principle the SP system is a model for any kind of software, it is likely to be some time before it would be feasible or sensible to translate all existing applications into the form of SP patterns.\n\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\n. The second main difference between the two models is that the relational model is designed purely for the storage and retrieval of knowledge while the SP model can, in addition, support a range of different kinds of intelligence, to be reviewed in Section 6.\n\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\n. Many kinds of knowledge that are outside the scope of the relational model can be accommodated in the SP system and, as we shall see, it overcomes the weaknesses of the relational model in representing hierarchical structures. At the same time, it can accommodate the relational model when that is required.\n\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\nAs the SP system matures, it may form hybrids with other systems in at least three different ways: • As noted previously (Section 2.4), the SP system is not yet a rival for wellestablished procedural languages like C++ or Cobol, and its application to arithmetic and other areas of mathematics needs development.\n\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\n. Since the SP system can model the operation of a universal Turing machine, it can, in principle, be used for any kind of arithmetic or mathematical operation and it can, in principle, perform any kind of 'procedure' that one might program in a procedural programming language such as C++ or Cobol.\n\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\nWithin the multiple alignment framework it is possible to represent knowledge in a format that is both simple and versatile, and processing within the framework provides a key to intelligence in the recognition of patterns, retrieval of information, probabilistic and exact kinds of reasoning, planning, problem solving and others. The versatility of the SP framework means that existing database models can be accommodated within the system and it can function in accordance with any one of those mo\n\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\nAt the heart of the SP system is the building of multiple alignments and the core operation here is a process for finding good full and partial matches between patterns in the manner of dynamic programming.\n\nAnswer the refined query using only the context above. Use numeric citations. If a claim lacks evidence write 'insufficient evidence'.\n\nReference index:\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\n[2] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n\nIMPORTANT OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\nYour final answer must end with a section titled 'References'.\nList all unique PDFs exactly once in the format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\nThis section must be at the end of your output.",
