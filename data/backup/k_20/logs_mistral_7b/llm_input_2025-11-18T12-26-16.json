Abstract—Ever since the Turing Test was proposed in the 1950s, humans have explored the mastering of language intelligence by machine.. Language is essentially a complex, intricate system of human expressions governed by grammatical rules. It poses a significant challenge to develop capable artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language.\n\n[2] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n. Within the scope of AI, the Turing Test, a widely recognized test for assessing intelligence by discerning if responses are of human or machine origin, has been a longstanding objective in AI evolution. It is generally believed among researchers that a computing machine that successfully passes the Turing Test can be considered as intelligent. . Consequently, when viewed from a wider lens, the chronicle of AI can be depicted as the timeline of creation and evaluation of intelligent models and\n\n[2] 3641289.pdf (2024)\nThis statement demonstrates that supervised models significantly outperform zero-shot models in terms of performance, highlighting that an increase in parameters does not necessarily guarantee a higher level of social knowledge in this particular scenario.. 3.1.2.

To summarize, the major contributions of this work are as follows: • The most complete survey of machine generated text detection to date, including previously omitted feature-based work and findings from recent contemporary research.. • The first detailed review of the threat models enabled by machine generated text, at a critical juncture where NLG models and tools are rapidly improving and proliferating. . • .

The technical evolution of LLMs has been making an important impact on the entire AI community, which would revolutionize the way how we develop and use AI algorithms. . Considering this rapid technical progress, in this survey, we review the recent advance\n\n[6] 2201.05273v4.pdf (2022)\n. Furthermore, to make summarization models produce more factual summaries, some studies proposed evaluation metrics or correction methods to measure and revise the generated text for preserving factuality.. Controllability. In text generation, many applications need a good control over the output text. . For example, to generate reading materials for kids, we would like to guide the output stories to be safe, educational and easily understandable by children.\n\n[9] N18-1202.pdf (2018)\nIn this paper, we introduce a new type of deep contextualized word representation that directly addresses both challenges, can be easily integrated into existing models, and significantly improves the state of the art in every considered case across a range of challenging language understanding problems.
