Since LLMs are trained to capture the data characteristics of pre-training corpora (including both high-quality and low-quality data), they are likely to generate toxic, biased, or even harmful content for humans. It is necessary to align LLMs with human values, e.g., helpful, honest, and harmless. . For this purpose, InstructGPT designs an effective tuning approach that enables LLMs to follow the expected instructions, which utilizes the technique of reinforcement learning with human feedback\n\n[4] 2005.14165v4.pdf (2020)\nOne potential route towards addressing these issues is meta-learning1 – which in the context of language models means the model develops a broad set of skills and pattern recognition abilities at training time, and then uses those abilities at inference time to rapidly adapt to or recognize the desired task (illustrated in Figure 1.1).\n\n[3] NatureDeepReview.pdf (2025)\nDeep-learning methods are representation-learning methods with multiple levels of representa tion, obtained by composing simple but non-linear modules that each transform the representation at one level (starting with the raw input) into a representation at a higher, slightly more abstract level.

In its overall abstract structure, the SP system is conceived as a system for unsupervised learning—and capabilities in this area have now been demonstrated in the SP70 computer model (Wolff, 2003c, 2002b).

We introduce a new type of deep contextualized word representation that models both (1) complex characteristics of word use (e.g., syntax and semantics), and (2) how these uses vary across linguistic contexts (i.e., to model polysemy). Our word vectors are learned functions of the internal states of a deep bidirectional language model (biLM), which is pretrained on a large text corpus.\n\n[2] 2201.05273v4.pdf (2022)\n. A representative example is Manakul et al., which proposed local self-attention, allowing longer input spans during training; and explicit content selection, reducing memory and compute requirements.. Furthermore, several researchers adopted divide-and-conquer encoding methods. By splitting the long document into short sentences, it is easier to summarize each short part of the document separately, reducing the computational complexity. . 3.1.3 Multi-lingual Representation Learning. .

As a remarkable contribution, the work in introduced the concept of distributed representation of words and built the word prediction function conditioned on the aggregated context features (i.e., the distributed word vectors). By extending the idea of learning effective features for text data, a general neural network approach was developed to build a unified, end-to-end solution for Fig. . 1: The trends of the cumulative numbers of arXiv papers that contain the keyphrases \"language model\" (s\n\n[10] 1810.04805v2.pdf (2019)\n. Learning widely applicable representations of words has been an active area of research for decades, including non-neural (Brown et al., 1992; Ando and Zhang, 2005; Blitzer et al., 2006) and neural (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al., 2014) methods. Pre-trained word embeddings are an integral part of modern NLP systems, offering significant improvements over embeddings learned from scratch.\n\n[6] 2303.18223v16.pdf (2025)\n. Specially, the language ability would relatively stable within a time interval, but qualitative change only occurs when evolving into another ability level (e.g., from speaking simple words to speaking simple sentences). Such a learning process is essentially not smooth and stable (i.e., language ability does not develop at a constant rate over time), though a child actually grows 10. .

We then examine some of the properties of universal intelligence, such as its ability to sensibly order simple learning algorithms and connections to the theory of universal optimal learning agents..

The expert system rule application to define training and test patterns is represented in the following medical expert system example.\n\n[12] 1910.10683v4.pdf (2023)\n. We also explore the limits of current approaches by scaling up the insights from our systematic study (training models up to 11 billion parameters) to obtain state-of-the-art results in many of the tasks we consider.
