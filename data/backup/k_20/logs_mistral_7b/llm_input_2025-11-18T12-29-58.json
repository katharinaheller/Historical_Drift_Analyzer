Never infer missing event years. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nCompare and contrast the main theoretical perspectives on summarize debates about ai autonomy and control in the 2020s., grounding historical claims only in explicit snippet content.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] 2201.05273v4.pdf (2022)\n. mRASP2 applied contrastive learning to minimize the representation gap of similar sentences Text summarization is the process of condensing text into a brief summary that retains key information from the source text.

Although these results, in and of themselves, may not ap pear earth-shattering, they do highlight an im portant point: outsiders (i.e., people other than the system's designers) were able to investigate and experimentally validate a knowledge engi neering exercise. This type of experimentation is rare in AI and almost unheard of in knowl edge engineering; it was possible, in large part, because of the transparency of the Bayes net formalism. .

We consistently maintain the related open-source materials at: INTRODUCTION Understanding the essence of intelligence and establishing whether a machine embodies it poses a compelling question for scientists.

These debates have in many instances been very heated as what is at stake is not merely a scientific definition, but a fundamental issue of how we measure and value humans: Is one employee smarter than another?. Are men on average more intelligent than women? Are white people smarter than black people? . As a result intelligence tests, and their creators, have on occasion been the subject of intense public scrutiny.\n\n[7] 1304.1106v1.pdf (1990)\n. The recent wave of work on Bayes nets, however, has suggested several diferent types of experiments: comparisons of different uncertainty formalisms, competi tions between Bayes nets and rule bases [14). [32), and several diferent approaches to (and motivations for) sensitivity analyses (29].
