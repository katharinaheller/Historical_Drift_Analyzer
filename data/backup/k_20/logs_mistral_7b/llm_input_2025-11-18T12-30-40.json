A popular speculation is that emergent abilities might be partially attributed to the evaluation setting for special tasks (e.g., the discontinuous evaluation metrics): when evaluation metrics are altered accordingly, the sharpness of the emergent ability curve would disappear. However, the performance of LLMs on most tasks are perceived by users naturally in a discontinuous way.\n\n[6] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\n.

The basic limitation currently, is to build expert systems with heuristic and empirical knowledge rather than deep knowledge, which include models of the functional and causal relations that underlie a problem. In the future, more systems might be developed using functional and causal models using a variety of representations. .

For example, DS-1000 (Lai et al. 2023) provides a large-scale benchmark of 1000 realistic problems spanning seven core Python data science libraries, with execution-based multi-criteria evaluation and mechanisms to reduce memorization bias.
