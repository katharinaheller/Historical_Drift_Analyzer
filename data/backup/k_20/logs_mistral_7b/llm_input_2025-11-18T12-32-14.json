Abstract—Ever since the Turing Test was proposed in the 1950s, humans have explored the mastering of language intelligence by machine.. Language is essentially a complex, intricate system of human expressions governed by grammatical rules. It poses a significant challenge to develop capable artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language.\n\n[5] 1301.3781v3.pdf (2013)\n. In this paper, we focus on distributed representations of words learned by neural networks, as it was previously shown that they perform significantly better than LSA for preserving linear regularities among words; LDA moreover becomes computationally very expensive on large data sets. Similar to, to compare different model architectures we define first the computational complexity of a model as the number of parameters that need to be accessed to fully train the model. . Next, we will try to\n\n[6] 2210.07321v4.pdf (2023)\nWe summarize our key findings as follows: • NLG models have significant potential for abuse in improving scaling and targeting of existing attacks • Platforms that receive text submissions of any kind are likely to face a growing influx of machine-generated text content, particularly as user-friendly tools continue to be developed • Much of the research on NLG-enabled influence operations focuses on AI-generated news articles, while sociological data suggest that machine generated comments may p\n\n[7] 1304.1083v1.pdf (1989)\n. Although it is widely acknowledged that much of human knowledge is uncertain, it is in the field of artificial intelligence that research on the representation and management of uncertainty in rule based reasoning has been focused (Kanal & Lemmer, 1986; Hink & Woods, 1987). Most of the work on uncertainty in artificial intelligence has so far been normative, stressing issues of mathematical correctness and effectiveness. .
