Abstract—Ever since the Turing Test was proposed in the 1950s, humans have explored the mastering of language intelligence by machine.. Language is essentially a complex, intricate system of human expressions governed by grammatical rules. It poses a significant challenge to develop capable artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language.\n\n[5] 2210.07321v4.pdf (2023)\n. It may be difficult to differentiate those who mean to exploit such systems (e.g., thoughtlessly spam submissions to as many avenues as possible), and those who are relying on AI writing tools to better express themselves.\n\n[10] 1304.1082v1.pdf (1990)\n. Comprehensible explanations of probabilistic reasoning are a prerequisite for wider acceptance of Bayesian methods in expert systems and decision support systems.\n\n[4] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\nThat said, most applications that have been developed to date have a 'declarative' flavour and the ways in which the system may be applied to arithmetic or other mathematical operations have not yet been explored in any depth (but see Wolff ). This has a bearing on how the system may be developed for database applications, as will be discussed in Section 7. .

The barriers to data analysis primarily exist in the following areas: •\nLack of systematic statistical training: Individuals without a background in statistics may find it challenging to understand which types of analysis are feasible, even when data is presented to them.
