You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3.

Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer.

Among other things, they can learn to output The future of deep learning Unsupervised learning91–98 had a catalytic effect in reviving interest in deep learning, but has since been overshadowed by the successes of purely supervised learning.

With the composition of enough such transformations, very complex functions can be learned. . For classification tasks, higher layers of representation amplify aspects of the input that are important fo\n\n[2] 1512.03385v1.pdf (2015)\n. Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train.. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. . We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. .\n\n[3] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n. People can also engage in question-and-answer interactions, where they pose questions to the model and receive answers, or engage in dialogue interactions, having natural language conversations with LLMs. In conclusion, LLMs, with their Transformer architecture, in-context learning, and RLHF capabilities, have revolutionized NLP and hold promise in various applications. . Table 1 provides a brief comparison of traditional ML, deep learning, and LLMs.\n\n[4] N18-1202.pdf (2018)\n. Unlike previous approaches for learning contextualized word vectors (Peters et al., 2017; McCann et al., 2017), ELMo representations are deep, in the sense that they are a function of all of the internal layers of the biLM. More specifically, we learn a linear combination of the vectors stacked above each input word for each end task, which markedly improves performance over just using the top LSTM layer. . Combining the internal states in this manner allows for very rich word representations.\n\n[1] NatureDeepReview.pdf (2025)\nWe think that deep learning will have many more successes in the near future because it requires very little engineering by hand, so it can easily take advantage of increases in the amount of available com putation and data.

Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are extremely powerful machine learning models that achieve excellent performance on difficult problems such as speech recognition and visual object recognition.. DNNs are powerful because they can perform arbitrary parallel computation for a modest number of steps. A surprising example of the power of DNNs is their ability to sort N N-bit numbers using only 2 hidden layers of quadratic size. . So, while neural networks are related to conventional statistical models\n\n[5] 1409.3215v3.pdf (2014)\nThe Connectionist Sequence Classification is another popular technique for mapping sequences to sequences with neural networks, but it assumes a monotonic alignment between the inputs and the outputs..

The extremely deep representations also have excellent generalization performance on other recognition tasks, and lead us to further win the 1st places on: ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation in ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions.

The expert system rule application to define training and test patterns is represented in the following medical expert system example.\n\n[1] NatureDeepReview.pdf (2025)\n. Systems combining deep learning and rein forcement learning are in their infancy, but they already outperform passive vision systems99 at classification tasks and produce impressive results in learning to play many different video games100. Natural language understanding is another area in which deep learn ing is poised to make a large impact over the next few years. . We expect systems that use RNNs to understand sentences or whole documents will become much better when they learn strategies\n\n[1] NatureDeepReview.pdf (2025)\n. Many applications of deep learning use feedforward neural net work architectures (Fig. 1), which learn to map a fixed-size input (for example, an image) to a fixed-size output (for example, a prob ability for each of several categories). To go from one layer to the next, a set of units compute a weighted sum of their inputs from the previous layer and pass the result through a non-linear function. . At present, the most popular non-linear function is the rectified linear unit (ReLU), which is\n\n[7] 2201.05273v4.pdf (2022)\n. An important merit of deep neural networks for text generation is that they enable end-to-end learning of semantic mappings from the input data to output texts without labor-intensive feature engineering. Moreover, deep neural models employ low-dimensional semantic representations to capture linguistic features of language, which is useful to alleviate data sparsity. . Despite the success of deep neural models for text generation, a major performance bottleneck lies in the availability of larg\n\n[7] 2201.05273v4.pdf (2022)\n. mRASP2 applied contrastive learning to minimize the representation gap of similar sentences Text summarization is the process of condensing text into a brief summary that retains key information from the source text.

In contrast, abstractive summarization generates the summa\n\n[1] NatureDeepReview.pdf (2025)\n. To properly adjust the weight vector, the learning algorithm com putes a gradient vector that, for each weight, indicates by what amount the error would increase or decrease if the weight were increased by a tiny amount. The weight vector is then adjusted in the opposite direc tion to the gradient vector. .
