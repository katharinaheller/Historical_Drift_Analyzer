Provide a precise definition, clarify theoretical foundations, and explain how interpretations evolved across time and publications. Use event years ONLY if explicitly stated in the snippets. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nDefine describe expert systems and their key components., describe its theoretical foundations, and explain how definitions evolved historically across publications.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] Expert_Systems.pdf (2016)\n. The general architecture of an expert system is presented in Figure 1 and its components are defined as follows (1): • User interface—the mechanism by which the user and the expert system communicate.. • Explanation facility—explains the reasoning of the system to a user. • Working memory—a database of facts used by the rules. . • Inference engine—makes inferences by deciding which rules are satisfied by facts or objects, prioritizes the satisfied rules, and executes the rule with the highest\n\n[1] Expert_Systems.pdf (2016)\n.

The expert system rule application to define training and test patterns is represented in the following medical expert system example.\n\n[2] 1304.1082v1.pdf (1990)\n. Comprehensible explanations of probabilistic reasoning are a prerequisite for wider acceptance of Bayesian methods in expert systems and decision support systems.\n\n[1] Expert_Systems.pdf (2016)\nTypical applications include management and administration (cost estimation, scheduling), industrial (process control, manufacturing quality control, fault diagnosis), medical (medical diagnosis in specialized domains, bacteria identification), banking (credit and loan decisions), and other fields (forecasting).

In this paper we approach the problem of defining machine intelligence as follows: Section 2 overviews well known theories, definitions and tests of intelligence that have been developed by psychologists. Our objective in this section is to gain an understanding of the essence of intelligence in the broadest possible terms. . In particular we are interested in commonly expressed ideas that could be applied to arbitrary systems and contexts, not just humans. . Section 3 takes these key ideas an\n\n[5] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\n. Chief amongst these is the remarkable simplicity of the system combined with its very wide scope, much wider than the great majority of artificial intelligence systems, with the possible exception of unified theories of cognition such as Soar (Laird et al., 1987; Rosenbloom et al., 1993) and ACT-R (Anderson and Lebiere, 1998). .

Ideally we would like to be able to measure the intelligence of a wide range of systems; humans, dogs, flies, robots or even disembodied systems such as chat-bots, expert systems, classification systems and prediction algorithms. [Joh92, Alb91]. One response to this problem might be to develop specific kinds of tests for specific kinds of entities; just as intelligence tests for children differ to intelligence tests for adults.\n\n[6] 1304.1106v1.pdf (1990)\n. [28), a rule-based expert system that used certainty factors, indicated that the cer tainty factors associated with the rules were not very important to the system's performance MYCIN's diagnoses were, in general, identi cal with the certainty factor engine on or off [3, pages 217-219).

The system is Turing-equivalent in the sense that it can model the workings of a universal Turing machine but, unlike the universal Turing machine and equivalent models such as Lamda Calculus or Post's Canonical System, it has much more to say about the nature of 'intelligence' (Wolff, 1999a).

  "model_output": "**Answer:**\n\nExpert Systems are knowledge-based systems that were developed under the umbrella of Artificial Intelligence (AI) around mid-1970s [1]. They can be defined as software that performs tasks requiring human expertise, by emulating human knowledge and skill [1]. Expert systems contain specialized knowledge elicited from a domain expert [1]. The general architecture consists of four main components: user interface, explanation facility, working memory, and inference engine [1]. The theoretical foundations of expert systems are based on the concept of IF-THEN rules, which are used to represent human expertise in the knowledge base [1]. Inferencing can be done through forward chaining or backward chaining [1]. Expert systems can also employ neural networks and fuzzy logic for knowledge representation and reasoning [1]. The evolution of definitions for expert systems has been recorded across publications. Early research established their viability, and since then, various commercial systems have been developed to demonstrate their use in real environments [1]. The limitations currently are building expert systems with deep knowledge rather than heuristic and empirical knowledge [1]. Inductive learning is used in neural network expert systems to prevent the knowledge acquisition bottleneck [1].
