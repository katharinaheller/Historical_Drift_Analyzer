Provide a precise definition, clarify theoretical foundations, and explain how interpretations evolved across time and publications. Use event years ONLY if explicitly stated in the snippets. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nDefine explain knowledge representation in expert systems according to the corpus., describe its theoretical foundations, and explain how definitions evolved historically across publications.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] Expert_Systems.pdf (2016)\n. After expert systems have moved out of research laboratories during early 1980s, they became more popular and found several application fields such as engineering, chemistry, medicine, industry, and many others.

Such representations are called distributed representations because their elements (the features) are not mutually exclusive and their many configurations correspond to the variations seen in the observed data.

  "model_output": "Artificial Intelligence's Expert Systems are defined as knowledge-intensive software that can perform tasks requiring human expertise, typically used to solve specific domain problems [1]. The construction process of expert systems with specialized domain knowledge is known as knowledge engineering [1]. Knowledge representation in these systems can originate from periodicals, books, or interviews with human experts [1]. Theoretical foundations of expert systems are rooted in Artificial Intelligence and emerged around the mid-1970s [1]. These systems consist of a user interface, explanation facility, working memory, and an inference engine [1]. The inference engine determines how the system reasons using IF–THEN rules in the knowledge base [1]. Historically, expert systems initially focused on classical approaches, but later developments included neural networks, fuzzy logic, and rough sets [1]. Explanation facilities for these systems were recognized as crucial for their wider acceptance [2]. More recent research has emphasized representation learning and the use of distributed representations [4].
