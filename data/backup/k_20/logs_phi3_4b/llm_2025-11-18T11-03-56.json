You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nCompare and contrast the main theoretical perspectives on contrast capability framing versus ethical framing of ai across the sources., grounding historical claims only in explicit snippet content.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n.

Abstract—Ever since the Turing Test was proposed in the 1950s, humans have explored the mastering of language intelligence by machine.. Language is essentially a complex, intricate system of human expressions governed by grammatical rules. It poses a significant challenge to develop capable artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language.\n\n[1] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n. As for new adversarial datasets, Wang et al. introduced AdvGLUE++ benchmark data for assessing adversarial robustness and implemented a new evaluation protocol to scrutinize machine ethics via jailbreaking system prompts.. 3.2.2 Ethics and Bias.\n\n[3] A Survey on Large Language Model-based Agents for Statistics and Data Science.pdf (2025)\n. Furthermore, InfiAgent-DABench (Hu et al. 2024) presents a end-to-end benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of data agents, the tasks require agents to end-to-end solving complex tasks by interacting with an execution environment. However, for tasks such as data visualization, the outputs are often difficult to compare directly. . Designing effective evaluation strategies for data visualizations remains an open and important question.\n\n[8] 2201.05273v4.pdf (2022)\nSimilarly, Liu et al. proposed two topic-aware contrastive learning objectives, among which the coherence detection objective identifies topics of a dialogue by detecting the coherence change among topics and the sub-summary generation objective forces the model to capture the most salient information and generate a sub-summary for each topic.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) development focuses on creating machine-based intelligence that can pass the Turing Test, thus being considered intelligent [1]. Here, the evaluation and creation of intelligent models are paramount. 2. The EU Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI emphasize ensuring lawful, ethical, and robust AI systems to prevent unintended or dual-use applications causing harm [2]. This perspective stresses sociotechnical and human-centric considerations. 3. Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant attention due to their impressive performance, raising the possibility that they could be considered AGI [1]. However, insufficient evidence is provided regarding the ethical implications of LLMs in this context. 4. The Turing Test was proposed in the 1950s as a benchmark for assessing intelligence by discerning human and machine responses [6]. This test serves as a historical marker for AI evolution.
