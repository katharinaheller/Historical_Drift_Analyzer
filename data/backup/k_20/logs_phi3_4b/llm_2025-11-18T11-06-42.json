Chief amongst these is the remarkable simplicity of the system combined with its very wide scope, much wider than the great majority of artificial intelligence systems, with the possible exception of unified theories of cognition such as Soar (Laird et al., 1987; Rosenbloom et al., 1993) and ACT-R (Anderson and Lebiere, 1998). .

Expert systems (ES) are knowledge-based systems that were one of the earlier research fields in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and can be defined as knowledgeintensive software that can perform some tasks normally requiring human expertise. Expert systems are used to solve specific domain problems and each step of reasoning for a specific problem is determined by the human expert professionally. . So, they behave as an artificial advisory system for a particular problem domain. . Although AI is\n\n[1] 1304.1082v1.pdf (1990)\nThere is a vast literature on human judgment under uncertainty for very simple inference problems, typically with a single hypothesis variable and a single observation (e.g. see Kahneman et al., 1982 and Morgan & Henrion, 1990 for reviews), but relatively little is known about cognitive processes in more complex situations. To improve our insights into this and to seek inspiration for alternative approaches to explanation, we conducted a series of cognitive process-tracing studies. . We recorded\n\n[9] 1304.1106v1.pdf (1990)\n. The recent wave of work on Bayes nets, however, has suggested several diferent types of experiments: comparisons of different uncertainty formalisms, competi tions between Bayes nets and rule bases [14). [32), and several diferent approaches to (and motivations for) sensitivity analyses (29]. For the most part, these studies ad dress the behavior of a system; although they are al system-specific, they should have some general implications to the way in which we approach system design. .

In the current paper we explore universal intelligence in much greater detail, in particular the way in which it relates to mainstream views on human intelligence and other proposed definitions of machine intelligence. Human intelligence is an enormously rich topic with a complex intellectual, social and political history. . For an overview the interested reader might want to consult \"Handbook of Intelligence\" .

Furthermore, the ongoing evolution of LLMs has also presented novel aspects for evaluation, thereby challenging existing evaluation protocols and reinforcing the need for thorough, multifaceted evaluation techniques. While existing research such as Bubeck et al. claimed that GPT-4 can be seen as sparks of AGI, others contest this claim due to the human-crafted nature of its evaluation approach. . This paper serves as the first comprehensive survey on the evaluation of large language models. .\n\n[1] 1304.1082v1.pdf (1990)\n. This can·drastically simplify the explanation, since many real cases seem to be like the example above, where a few (two to four) scenarios turn out to have the bulk of the probability, and the vast mass can be ignored without significant error. Thirdly, in comparisons of the relative probability of pairs of scenarios, only those events with substantially different probabilities are mentioned. . Additional abstraction techniques could provide further simplification. . Some linked variables mig\n\n[1] 1304.1082v1.pdf (1990)\n. However, human qualitative belief propagation appears to trace the impact of evidence locally from node to node, which seems more reminiscent of the quantitative belief propagation or message-passing algorithms developed by Pearl and others than the reduction type algorithms.\n\n[10] 2303.18223v16.pdf (2025)\n. Abstract—Ever since the Turing Test was proposed in the 1950s, humans have explored the mastering of language intelligence by machine.. Language is essentially a complex, intricate system of human expressions governed by grammatical rules. It poses a significant challenge to develop capable artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language.\n\nAnswer the refined query using only the context above.

  "model_output": "Comparative Analysis of Theoretical Perspectives on Human and Artificial Reasoning:\n\n1. In the 1980s and 1990s, research focused on representing and managing uncertainty in rule-based reasoning within artificial intelligence was emphasized [2]. This work often stressed mathematical correctness and effectiveness, aiming to be normative. A study of human reasoning under uncertainty conducted around this period provided inspiration for two distinct modes of explaining probabilistic reasoning: qualitative belief propagation and scenario-based reasoning [1]. 2. The approach taken in the 1980s was normative, while the method used in the aforementioned study was descriptive [2]. The descriptive study aimed to produce interpretations of probabilistic reasoning that were more compatible with human reasoning styles [1]. There is evidence suggesting that normatively appealing probabilistic and decision theoretic schemes are poor models of human reasoning under uncertainty, but there is surprisingly little experimental evidence that rule-based alternatives such as certainty factors or fuzzy logic are any better as descriptive models [1]. 3. In 2018, a new theory called the SP theory was introduced with an aim to integrate and simplify concepts in computing and cognitive science, particularly artificial intelligence [3]. The SP theory offers an attractive model for database applications, emphasizing human-like 'intuitive' inference [6]. On the other hand, neural networks just use big activity vectors, big weight matrices, and scalar non-linearities to perform fast intuitive inference [6]. 4. A fundamental problem in artificial intelligence is that nobody really knows what intelligence is, especially when considering artificial systems significantly different from humans [4]. In 2025, a survey on the evaluation of large language models concluded that ongoing evolution has presented novel aspects for evaluation, challenging existing protocols and reinforcing the need for thorough, multifaceted evaluation techniques [7].
