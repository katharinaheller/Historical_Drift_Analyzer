Abstract—Ever since the Turing Test was proposed in the 1950s, humans have explored the mastering of language intelligence by machine..

This comprehensive survey is intended to help researchers interested in text generation problems to learn the core concepts, the main techniques and the latest developments in this area based on PLMs. INTRODUCTION Text generation, also known as natural language generation, has been one of the most important sub-fields in natural language processing (NLP). .

Within the scope of AI, the Turing Test, a widely recognized test for assessing intelligence by discerning if responses are of human or machine origin, has been a longstanding objective in AI evolution.

However, Lee et al. observed LLMs perform poorly in the scope of NLI and further fail in representing human disagreement, which indicates that LLMs still have large room for improvement in this field. Semantic understanding refers to the meaning or understanding of language and its associated concepts. . It involves the interpretation and comprehension of words, phrases, sentences, and the relationships between them. .

For example, a white-box training data extraction attack targeting the weights of a commercial speech-to-text model would not be included in our analysis, but using an NLG model to produce data for poisoning that model's training dataset would.

To understand the risks that motivate research on detection of machine generated text, we draw from existing literature to present a series of threat models incorporating natural language generation. Threat modeling reflects the process of thinking like an attacker, identifying vulnerabilities to systems by identifying potential attackers, their capabilities, and objectives. .

KG-BART investigates the commonsense generation, i.e., generating a natural language consisting of provided commonsense concept (word), which can be considered as the hard-constrained conditional generation. Moreover, text style transfer aims to convert a text into another style while preserving the basic semantics of input, such as sentiment transfer and writing style transfer. . In addition, some researchers devoted to literary creation, such as poem and lyric. . In this survey, we presented\n\n[1] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n.

  "model_output": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) literature conceptualizes natural language understanding as a crucial aspect for AI systems, aiming to enable machines to comprehend, interpret, and generate human language [1], [2], [5]. This understanding encompasses semantic meaning, grammatical rules, and relationships between words, phrases, and sentences [1], [4], [7]. The Turing Test, proposed in the 1950s, is a well-known benchmark for evaluating AI systems' intelligence by differentiating human responses from machine responses [1], [7]. However, over time, there has been an increasing focus on large language models (LLMs) due to their exceptional performance in various natural language tasks [1], [3], [4]. Theoretical foundations of natural language understanding in AI evolved from statistical language models to neural language models over the past two decades [4]. Recent advancements involve combining deep learning and reinforcement learning, improving the capabilities of systems for classification tasks, video games, and various natural language understanding tasks such as topic classification, sentiment analysis, question answering, and language translation [3], [4], [6]. The definition of natural language understanding has been expanded to include commonsense generation, text style transfer, literary creation, and in-context learning [2]. Furthermore, research on machine generated text detection and adversarial robustness has also gained traction to identify vulnerabilities and improve the security of systems [7].
