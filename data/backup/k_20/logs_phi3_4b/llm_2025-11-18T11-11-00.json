Abstract—Ever since the Turing Test was proposed in the 1950s, humans have explored the mastering of language intelligence by machine.. Language is essentially a complex, intricate system of human expressions governed by grammatical rules. It poses a significant challenge to develop capable artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language.\n\n[7] A Survey on Large Language Model-based Agents for Statistics and Data Science.pdf (2025)\nWe explore current trends in the design of LLM-based frameworks, detailing essential features such as planning, reasoning, reflection, multi-agent collaboration, user interface, knowledge integration, and system design, which enable agents to address data-centric problems with minimal human intervention. Furthermore, we analyze several case studies to demonstrate the practical applications of various data agents in realworld scenarios. . Finally, we identify key challenges and propose future res\n\n[8] 1304.1083v1.pdf (1989)\n. Although it is widely acknowledged that much of human knowledge is uncertain, it is in the field of artificial intelligence that research on the representation and management of uncertainty in rule based reasoning has been focused (Kanal & Lemmer, 1986; Hink & Woods, 1987). Most of the work on uncertainty in artificial intelligence has so far been normative, stressing issues of mathematical correctness and effectiveness. . The approach taken in this paper is not normative, but descriptive. . I\n\n[5] 2303.18223v16.pdf (2025)\n. They reported a difference between the training of ChatGPT and InstructGPT in the data collection setup: human-generated conversations (playing both the roles of user and AI) are combined with the InstructGPT dataset in a dialogue format for training ChatGPT.\n\n[3] 0712.3329v1.pdf (2007)\nIn this paper we approach this problem in the following way: We take a number of well known informal definitions of human intelligence that have been given by experts, and extract their essential features. These are then mathematically formalised to produce a general measure of intelligence for arbitrary machines. . We believe that this equation formally captures the concept of machine intelligence in the broadest reasonable sense. . We then show how this formal definition is related to the theo\n\n[6] 1304.1082v1.pdf (1990)\n. Since our goal is to produce interpretations of probabilistic reasoning that are more compatible with human reasoning styles, we started out with an empirical study of human strategies for uncertain reasoning. This provided us with the inspiration for the design of two new and contrasting modes of explaining probabilistic reasoning, namely qualitative belief propagation and scenario-based reasoning. . It is useful to distinguish explanation as the communication of static knowledge or beliefs f\n\n[2] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n. A significant takeaway from previous attempts is the paramount importance of AI evaluation, which serves as a critical tool to identify current system limitations and inform the design of more powerful models. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have incited substantial interest across both academic and industrial domains. . As demonstrated by existing work, the great performance of LLMs has raised promise that they could be AGI in this era. . LLMs possess the capabilities to solve diverse\n\n[5] 2303.18223v16.pdf (2025)\nRecently, the research on LLMs has been largely advanced by both academia and industry, and a remarkable progress is the launch of ChatGPT (a powerful AI chatbot developed based on LLMs), which has attracted widespread attention from society. The technical evolution of LLMs has been making an important impact on the entire AI community, which would revolutionize the way how we develop and use AI algorithms. . Considering this rapid technical progress, in this survey, we review the recent advance\n\n[3] 0712.3329v1.pdf (2007)\n. A fundamental problem in artificial intelligence is that nobody really knows what intelligence is.. The problem is especially acute when we need to consider artificial systems which are significantly different to humans.\n\n[9] 1304.1106v1.pdf (1990)\n. Although these results, in and of themselves, may not ap pear earth-shattering, they do highlight an im portant point: outsiders (i.e., people other than the system's designers) were able to investigate and experimentally validate a knowledge engi neering exercise. This type of experimentation is rare in AI and almost unheard of in knowl edge engineering; it was possible, in large part, because of the transparency of the Bayes net formalism. . Verifiable, reproducible, and controlled ex perime\n\n[2] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n. Furthermore, the ongoing evolution of LLMs has also presented novel aspects for evaluation, thereby challenging existing evaluation protocols and reinforcing the need for thorough, multifaceted evaluation techniques. While existing research such as Bubeck et al. claimed that GPT-4 can be seen as sparks of AGI, others contest this claim due to the human-crafted nature of its evaluation approach. . This paper serves as the first comprehensive survey on the evaluation of large language models. .\n\nAnswer the refined query using only the context above. Use numeric citations.

  "model_output": "The main theoretical perspectives on human-AI collaboration are framed through the following lenses:\n\n1. Text Summarization Approaches ([1], [2022])\n   - Extractive summarization: selecting a subset of sentences from the source text and concatenating them to form the summary. - Abstractive summarization: generating the summary by learning to represent the source text and understanding its semantics. 2. The Turing Test ([2], [2024])\n   - A widely recognized test for assessing intelligence based on discerning if responses are of human or machine origin. A machine that successfully passes this test can be considered as intelligent. 3. Universal Intelligence and AI Evolution ([3], [2007]; [2], [2024])\n   - Human intelligence is an intricate topic with a complex intellectual, social, and political history. Researchers focus on developing machine-based intelligence to embody reasoning capabilities, test hypotheses, and prepare for future eventualities. 4. Trustworthy AI ([4], [2023])\n   - Emphasizes that AI systems should be lawful, ethical, and robust from both a technical and sociotechnical perspective, with consideration given to the humans who will be exposed to AI in daily life. 5. Language Intelligence in AI ([5], [2025]; [2], [2024])\n   - Language is a complex system of human expressions governed by grammatical rules, which poses a significant challenge to develop capable artificial intelligence algorithms for comprehending and grasping it. 6. Large Language Models (LLMs) ([5], [2025]; [2], [2024])\n   - LLMs have been the focus of recent research, possessing capabilities to solve diverse tasks such as answering questions, translating text, and writing essays. They are believed to be at the forefront of AI development, with ChatGPT being a notable example.
