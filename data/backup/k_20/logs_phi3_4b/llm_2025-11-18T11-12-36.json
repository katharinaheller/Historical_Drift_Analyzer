Expert systems (ES) are knowledge-based systems that were one of the earlier research fields in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and can be defined as knowledgeintensive software that can perform some tasks normally requiring human expertise.

We introduce a new type of deep contextualized word representation that models both (1) complex characteristics of word use (e.g., syntax and semantics), and (2) how these uses vary across linguistic contexts (i.e., to model polysemy).

  "model_output": "Artificial Agent Definition and Evolution Across Publications:\n\nAn artificial agent, as defined in recent publications [1], is an autonomous or semi-autonomous software system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), capable of understanding natural language instructions, planning and executing data-centric tasks, and interacting with users or external tools to accomplish complex objectives ranging from exploratory data analysis to machine learning model development. Theoretical Foundations:\nThe SP theory, introduced in [2], provides a framework for processing knowledge that integrates and simplifies various artificial intelligence functions like probabilistic and exact reasoning, unsupervised learning, fuzzy pattern recognition, best-match information retrieval, planning, and problem-solving. The GloVe model [9] is another approach for word representation learning from the statistics of word occurrences in a corpus. Evolution of Definitions:\nIn earlier research, expert systems [6] were defined as knowledge-intensive software that could perform tasks requiring human expertise in specific domains. The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark for measuring machine intelligence in the 1950s (event year not stated; described in 2018 PDF [7]), although it has since been debated and expanded upon [4].
