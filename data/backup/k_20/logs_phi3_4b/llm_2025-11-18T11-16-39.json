Since our goal is to produce interpretations of probabilistic reasoning that are more compatible with human reasoning styles, we started out with an empirical study of human strategies for uncertain reasoning.

Within the scope of AI, the Turing Test, a widely recognized test for assessing intelligence by discerning if responses are of human or machine origin, has been a longstanding objective in AI evolution.

Even in a probabilistic setting, deterministic qualitative relations are likely to play a significant role in definitions, accounting relations, and constraints (for instance, in constrained opti mization problems.

To motivate the approach, they introduced a probabilistic form for multi-task solving, i.e., p(output|input, task) (similar approaches have been adopted in ), which predicts the output conditioned on the input and task information.

We consistently maintain the related open-source materials at: INTRODUCTION Understanding the essence of intelligence and establishing whether a machine embodies it poses a compelling question for scientists. It is generally agreed upon that authentic intelligence equips us with reasoning capabilities, enables us to test hypotheses, and prepares for future eventualities. . In particular, Artificial Intelligence (AI) researchers focus on the development of machine-based intelligence, as opposed\n\n[6] Expert_Systems.pdf (2016)\n. Expert systems (ES) are knowledge-based systems that were one of the earlier research fields in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and can be defined as knowledgeintensive software that can perform some tasks normally requiring human expertise. Expert systems are used to solve specific domain problems and each step of reasoning for a specific problem is determined by the human expert professionally. . So, they behave as an artificial advisory system for a particular problem domain. . Although AI is\n\n[1] 1304.1082v1.pdf (1990)\n. By now the most familiar display of qualitative probabilistic information is the Bayesian belief net (and influence diagram), which prȿvi3es a. perspicuous display of purely quahtɀt1ve beliefs about conditional dependence and Independence. Figure 2 provides a belief network for probabilistic knowledge for the \"sneeze\" example. . The nodes depict the key variables. .

Functional dependencies restrict the potential interactions among variables connected in a probabilistic network.\n\n[3] 1304.1081v1.pdf (1990)\n. Because neither relation subsumes the other, special treat ment of deterministic variables for reasoning about synergy is required for soundness if the special in terpretation of deterministic synergy is adopted. The question, then, is what inference rules are sanc tioned for probabilistic and deterministic variables and combinations. . Let us focus on the operation of reducing c in the network fragment of Figure 7. . If both c and d are probabilistic, the QPN update rule dictates the new syne\n\n[3] 1304.1081v1.pdf (1990)\nI describe how to accomplish these modi fications in qualitative probabilistic networks by exhibiting the update procedures for graphical transformations involving probabilistic and de terministic variables and combinations. A sim ple example demonstrates that the augmented scheme can reduce qualitative ambiguity that would arise without the special treatment of functional dependency. . Analysis of qualitative synergy reveals that new higher-order relations are required to reason effectively abo\n\n[3] 1304.1081v1.pdf (1990)\n. Indeed, the ability to de rive stronger qualitative conclusions from networks containing deterministic relations is ultimately due to the extra independencies sanctioned by the func tional constraints. Specification of deterministic variables in proba bilistic network representations was introduced by Shachter for numeric influence diagrams. . The hybrid representation scheme presented here extends the qualitative probabilistic network (QPN) formal ism to accommodate determin istic relations.\n\nAnswer the refined query using only the context above.

To motivate the approach, they introduced a probabilistic form for multi-task solving, i.e., p(output|input, task) (similar approaches have been adopted in ), which predicts the output conditioned on the input and task information. To model this conditional probability, language text can be naturally employed as a unified way to format input, output and task information. . In this way, the process of solving a task can be cast as a word prediction problem for generating the solution text.",

  "model_output": "Artificial Intelligence Reasoning and Probabilistic Logic Definition, Theoretical Foundations, and Historical Evolution\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) reasoning is closely connected to probabilistic logic through the use of Bayesian networks, influence diagrams, and qualitative belief propagation [1, 3]. These techniques allow for the modeling and inference of uncertain knowledge, which are essential components of human-like reasoning. The theoretical foundations of AI reasoning and probabilistic logic can be traced back to the 1990s, as demonstrated by works such as the study on qualitative belief propagation [1] and research on functional dependencies in probabilistic networks [3]. These studies aimed at developing explanations compatible with human reasoning styles and improving the acceptance of Bayesian methods in expert systems. The connection between AI reasoning and probabilistic logic has evolved over time, with key developments being made in the 2010s and beyond. For example, there are attempts to incorporate probabilistic forms for multi-task solving [5], and the integration of various artificial intelligence functions such as probabilistic reasoning, unsupervised learning, and best-match information retrieval [2]. In the context of expert systems, AI researchers have focused on developing machine-based intelligence that equips machines with reasoning capabilities [4, 6]. The Turing Test is a longstanding objective in AI evolution, which has been used as a benchmark for measuring a computing machine's level of intelligence [4].
