Provide a precise definition, clarify theoretical foundations, and explain how interpretations evolved across time and publications. Use event years ONLY if explicitly stated in the snippets. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number.

You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3.

Although it is widely acknowledged that much of human knowledge is uncertain, it is in the field of artificial intelligence that research on the representation and management of uncertainty in rule based reasoning has been focused (Kanal & Lemmer, 1986; Hink & Woods, 1987).

Other recent work has also focused on learning context-dependent representations. . context2vec uses a bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM; Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) to encode the context around a pivot word.\n\n[7] D14-1162.pdf (2014)\n. Collobert and Weston decoupled the word vector training from the downstream training objectives, which paved the way for Collobert et al. to use the full context of a word for learning the word representations, rather than just the preceding context as is the case with language models. Recently, the importance of the full neural network structure for learning useful word representations has been called into question. .

And even if successful descriptively, the emulative approach would merely reproduce the documented deficiencies of our intuitive reasoning rather than\n\n[6] N18-1202.pdf (2018)\n. We introduce a new type of deep contextualized word representation that models both (1) complex characteristics of word use (e.g., syntax and semantics), and (2) how these uses vary across linguistic contexts (i.e., to model polysemy). Our word vectors are learned functions of the internal states of a deep bidirectional language model (biLM), which is pretrained on a large text corpus.\n\n[8] NatureDeepReview.pdf (2025)\n. Although deep learning and simple reasoning have been used for speech and handwriting recognition for a long time, new paradigms are needed to replace rule-based manipulation of symbolic expressions by operations on large vectors101.. ■ Figure 5 | A recurrent neural network and the unfolding in time of the computation involved in its forward computation.\n\n[2] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\n. The second main difference between the two models is that the relational model is designed purely for the storage and retrieval of knowledge while the SP model can, in addition, support a range of different kinds of intelligence, to be reviewed in Section 6.\n\n[9] 2005.14165v4.pdf (2020)\nRecent work [RWC+19] attempts to do this via what we call \"in-context learning\", using the text input of a pretrained language model as a form of task specification: the model is conditioned on a natural language instruction and/or a few demonstrations of the task and is then expected to complete further instances of the task simply by predicting what comes next.\n\n[10] 2303.18223v16.pdf (2025)\n. As a remarkable contribution, the work in introduced the concept of distributed representation of words and built the word prediction function conditioned on the aggregated context features (i.e., the distributed word vectors). By extending the idea of learning effective features for text data, a general neural network approach was developed to build a unified, end-to-end solution for Fig. . 1: The trends of the cumulative numbers of arXiv papers that contain the keyphrases \"language model\" (s\n\nAnswer the refined query using only the context above.

  "model_output": "The importance of context completeness for retrieval-based reasoning is highlighted as crucial in various publications throughout the history of artificial intelligence. In the 1980s and 1990s, researchers focused on the development of expert systems and decision support systems that could provide explanations of their computer-based reasoning to users ([3] 1304.1082v1.pdf (1990)). This was deemed essential for wider acceptance of these systems, especially since they relied on uncertain knowledge and probabilistic reasoning. In the 2010s, there was a shift towards using large language models (LLMs) to facilitate incontext learning and improve the level of faithfulness in generated summaries ([4] 2201.05273v4.pdf (2022)). Context completeness became important for LLM-based agents to access and interact with external knowledge sources, such as databases or knowledge graphs, to augment their reasoning capabilities ([1] A Survey on Large Language Model-based Agents for Statistics and Data Science.pdf (2025)). More recent publications discuss the importance of context completeness in deep learning models for speech and handwriting recognition ([8] NatureDeepReview.pdf (2025)), and the development of contextualized word representations that model complex characteristics of word use and how these uses vary across linguistic contexts ([6] N18-1202.pdf (2018)). Theoretical foundations for context completeness can be traced back to the work on ontologies, 'semantic' retrieval of information, and probabilistic reasoning in the 1980s ([2] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)). This was followed by the development of relational models for the storage and retrieval of knowledge and the SP model that supports a range of different kinds of intelligence ([2] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)). Over time, the emphasis on context completeness has evolved to address the need for improved reasoning capabilities in AI systems, particularly LLMs and deep learning models. This evolution is marked by a shift from focusing on explanations of probabilistic reasoning in expert systems to the development of contextualized word representations that model complex characteristics of word use across various linguistic contexts.
