Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number.

You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3.

A representative example is Manakul et al., which proposed local self-attention, allowing longer input spans during training; and explicit content selection, reducing memory and compute requirements..

As a major approach, language modeling has been widely studied for language understanding and generation in the past two decades, evolving from statistical language models to neural language models.\n\n[3] 2201.05273v4.pdf (2022)\n. Furthermore, to make summarization models produce more factual summaries, some studies proposed evaluation metrics or correction methods to measure and revise the generated text for preserving factuality.. Controllability. In text generation, many applications need a good control over the output text. . For example, to generate reading materials for kids, we would like to guide the output stories to be safe, educational and easily understandable by children.\n\n[5] 2303.18223v16.pdf (2025)\nFurthermore, word2vec was proposed to build a simplified shallow neural network for learning distributed word representations, which were demonstrated to be very effective across a variety of NLP tasks. These studies have initiated the use of language models for representation learning (beyond word sequence modeling), having an important impact on the field of NLP. . • Pre-trained language models (PLM).\n\n[4] 2005.14165v4.pdf (2020)\nRecent work [RWC+19] attempts to do this via what we call \"in-context learning\", using the text input of a pretrained language model as a form of task specification: the model is conditioned on a natural language instruction and/or a few demonstrations of the task and is then expected to complete further instances of the task simply by predicting what comes next.\n\n[9] NatureDeepReview.pdf (2025)\n.

The SP theory is a new theory of computing and cognition developed with the aim of integrating and simplifying a range of concepts in computing and cognitive science, with a particular emphasis on concepts in artificial intelligence.

In the development of the SP theory, computer models have been created as a way of reducing vagueness and inconsistencies in the theory, as a way of verifying that the system really does work according to expectations, and as a means of demonstrating what the system can do.

  "model_output": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on training agents to take actions within an environment to maximize cumulative rewards over time. The theoretical foundation lies in optimizing policies, which are functions mapping states to actions. RL models learn from the consequences of their actions through trial and error [4]. The concept of RL can be traced back to Samuel's checkers-playing program (1952), but it gained significant attention with Sutton and Barto's book \"Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction\" in 1998 [5]. In this work, they introduced the Markov decision process (MDP) as a mathematical framework for analyzing RL problems. In recent years, there has been significant progress in applying RL to natural language processing tasks. For example, inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) was used to address reward sparsity and mode collapse problems in GAN-based text generation [1]. Furthermore, RL techniques have been employed to train large-scale language models for various applications such as dialogue systems, summarization, and text generation [2, 3, 5].
