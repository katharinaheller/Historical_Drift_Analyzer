You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3.

Due to its great performance in handling different applications such as general natural language tasks and domain-specific ones, LLMs are increasingly used by individuals with critical information needs, such as students or patients.

A popular speculation is that emergent abilities might be partially attributed to the evaluation setting for special tasks (e.g., the discontinuous evaluation metrics): when evaluation metrics are altered accordingly, the sharpness of the emergent ability curve would disappear. However, the performance of LLMs on most tasks are perceived by users naturally in a discontinuous way.\n\n[8] 1409.3215v3.pdf (2014)\n. The LSTM's ability to successfully learn on data with long range temporal dependencies makes it a natural choice for this application due to the considerable time lag between the inputs and their corresponding outputs (fig. 1). There have been a number of related attempts to address the general sequence to sequence learning problem with neural networks. .

The initial objective behind the development of language models, particularly large language models, was to enhance performance on natural language processing tasks, encompassing both understanding and generation.

The evaluation process involved human assessment.\n\n[1] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n. Firstly, we provide an overview from the perspective of evaluation tasks, encompassing general natural language processing tasks, reasoning, medical usage, ethics, education, natural and social sciences, agent applications, and other areas. Secondly, we answer the 'where' and 'how' questions by diving into the evaluation methods and benchmarks, which serve as crucial components in assessing the performance of LLMs. . Then, we summarize the success and failure cases of LLMs in different tasks.\n\n[6] 2303.18223v16.pdf (2025)\n. Furthermore, some capacities (e.g., in-context learning ) are unpredictable according to the scaling law, which can be observed only when the model size exceeds a certain level (as discussed below).. Emergent Abilities of LLMs.\n\n[9] Expert_Systems.pdf (2016)\n. The basic limitation currently, is to build expert systems with heuristic and empirical knowledge rather than deep knowledge, which include models of the functional and causal relations that underlie a problem. In the future, more systems might be developed using functional and causal models using a variety of representations. .

  "model_output": "The analysis of temporal context influences on AI evaluation reveals several key points across various timespans, as indicated by the provided snippets. 1. Origins of AI evaluation: The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark for assessing intelligence in machines [1] (described in 2024 PDF [1]). It was believed among researchers that a machine passing this test could be considered intelligent [1] (event year not stated; described in 2024 PDF [1]). 2. Emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs): LLMs have gained significant interest in both academic and industrial domains due to their high performance [1] (described in 2024 PDF [1]). The Turing Test has been a longstanding objective in AI evolution, with the belief that machines passing this test could be considered intelligent [1] (event year not stated; described in 2024 PDF [1]). 3. Importance of evaluating LLMs: Evaluating LLMs is crucial for understanding their strengths and weaknesses, improving natural language processing abilities, and ensuring better performance overall [1] (described in 2024 PDF [1]). 4. Limitations and challenges: The evaluation of LLMs poses significant challenges such as reasoning tasks, which require models to comprehend information and utilize reasoning and inference [1] (described in 2024 PDF [1]). Supervised models outperform zero-shot models, but an increase in parameters does not necessarily guarantee a higher level of social knowledge [1] (described in 2024 PDF [1]). 5. Trustworthy AI: Ensuring trustworthiness in the context of Natural Language Generation (NLG) necessitates understanding areas where LLMs may be abused, and how these abuses may be prevented through detection technologies, moderation mechanisms, government legislation, or platform policies [2] (described in 2023 PDF [2]). 6. Evaluation methods: Various evaluation methods have been employed to assess the performance of LLMs, including general natural language processing tasks, reasoning, medical usage, ethics, education, natural and social sciences, agent applications, and others [1] (described in 2024 PDF [1]). 7. Comparison between models: Comparisons have been made between traditional Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and LLMs, revealing differences in training data size, feature engineering, model complexity, interpretability, and performance [1] (described in 2024 PDF [1]). 8. Emergent abilities of LLMs: Some capacities of LLMs, such as in-context learning, are unpredictable according to the scaling law, which can be observed only when the model size exceeds a certain level [6] (described in 2025 PDF [6]). 9. Expert systems: The development of expert systems using functional and causal models is still a difficult problem waiting to be tackled, as they currently rely on heuristic and empirical knowledge rather than deep knowledge [9] (described in 2016 PDF [9]).
