  "model_output": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) evolution has been characterized by a shift from symbolic AI to data-driven AI, with the latter posing challenges to interpretability and understanding. The Turing Test [2] was proposed in the 1950s as a benchmark for assessing intelligence, and it is still recognized as a significant milestone in AI evolution [3]. The Turing Test aims to distinguish human responses from those generated by machines, but passing this test does not necessarily imply that an AI system has a level of social knowledge equivalent to humans [2]. Data-driven AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) or Vision-Language Models (VLMs), have gained increasing recognition in recent years [1]. These models are designed to comprehend and generate human-like text, but they do not necessarily possess the ability to reason or infer like humans [2]. This poses a challenge for data-driven AI as it requires them to not only comprehend information but also utilize reasoning and inference [2]. The theoretical foundations of data-driven AI are rooted in machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing techniques. These models learn patterns from large amounts of data, allowing them to generate human-like text, understand tabular data, and effectively extract insights from various types of input data [1, 4]. However, understanding the essence of intelligence and establishing whether a machine embodies it remains a compelling question for scientists [2]. The interpretability challenges in data-driven AI have evolved over time. Early AI systems were symbolic, relying on rules and logic to make decisions. These systems were highly interpretable because their decisions could be traced back to specific rules [5]. However, as AI shifted towards data-driven approaches, the decision-making process became more opaque, making it difficult to understand why a particular decision was made [6]. This has led to a focus on explainability and interpretability in modern AI systems.
