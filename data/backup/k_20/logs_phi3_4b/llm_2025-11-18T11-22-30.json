Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number.

You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3.

By presenting a broad characterization of GPT-3's strengths and weaknesses, including these limitations, we hope to stimulate study of few-shot learning in language models and draw attention to where progress is most needed.

The basic limitation currently, is to build expert systems with heuristic and empirical knowledge rather than deep knowledge, which include models of the functional and causal relations that underlie a problem.

Despite these efforts, a comprehensive overview capturing the entire gamut of evaluations is still lacking.\n\n[4] 2210.07321v4.pdf (2023)\nThird, guided by the EU Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI and research community efforts, we present our survey with sociotechnical and human-centric considerations integrated throughout, focusing not only on NLG systems and machine text detection technologies, but on the humans who will be exposed to both text generation and detection systems in daily life.

Removing this limitation would be desirable, for several reasons. . Second, the potential to exploit spurious correlations in training data fundamentally grows w\n\n[4] 2210.07321v4.pdf (2023)\n. An individual or group of motivated individuals may register social media accounts to be controlled by automation tools, or use a common bot to post from their own account, in order to generate a large volume of messages targeting a particular individual or community.

While a completely exhaustive list of all possible future malicious applications of NLG models is not possible, the threats outlined here span a wide range of tangible dangers at this point in time, representing valuable areas of future investigation for preemptive ethical defensive research. As previously mentioned, threat modeling is iterative, and it is hoped that these threat models should serve as the foundation for future work in improving security against machine generated text. . 3.2.1\n\n[6] A Survey on Large Language Model-based Agents for Statistics and Data Science.pdf (2025)\n. The barriers to data analysis primarily exist in the following areas: •\nLack of systematic statistical training: Individuals without a background in statistics may find it challenging to understand which types of analysis are feasible, even when data is presented to them. As data and models become increasingly complex, gaining a solid understanding of current statistical techniques typically requires at least a Master's level of statistical training. . •\nSoftware limitation: Simple data analys\n\n[4] 2210.07321v4.pdf (2023)\n. Among these should be measures to protect against social media abuse more broadly, including detection of account automation, and scrutiny of coordinated inauthentic activity for content amplification. Investigations by disinformation researchers, such as those carried out on Twitter, are likely to remain relevant. . 3.3.2 Commercial Influence Campaigns. . In commercial influence campaigns, the goal is to influence individuals in a manner that commercially benefits the threat actor.\n\n[4] 2210.07321v4.pdf (2023)\n.

  "model_output": "The ethical tensions between automation and accountability have been a topic of interest over the years, with various discussions on the strengths, limitations, and mechanisms involved. However, it is not explicitly stated when this conversation began (event year not stated; described in 2016 PDF [3], 2020 PDF [1], 2023 PDF [4], and 2024 PDF [2]). One key aspect of these discussions revolves around the evaluation of AI systems, particularly large language models (LLMs), for trustworthiness. Researchers have been examining various critical aspects such as toxicity, stereotype bias, adversarial and out-of-distribution robustness, privacy, machine ethics, and fairness (2024 PDF [2]). The EU ethics guidelines for trustworthy AI emphasize preventing unintended or dual-use applications of AI systems to cause harm (2023 PDF [4]). Additionally, concerns have been raised about the potential abuse of AI systems, particularly NLG models, in malicious activities such as social media abuse, commercial influence campaigns, and account automation (2023 PDF [4], 2025 PDF [6]). Large language models like GPT-3 have been found to exhibit moral biases based on the Moral Foundation theory (2024 PDF [2]), and some studies have discovered cultural and conversational biases in these models as well (2024 PDF [2]). However, research is ongoing to improve these systems and address their biases (insufficient evidence). In terms of strengths, LLMs have been shown to possess capabilities to solve diverse tasks, raising the possibility that they could be artificial general intelligence (AGI) in this era (2024 PDF [2]). Furthermore, these models can help address data analysis barriers by providing agents capable of planning, reasoning, reflection, multi-agent collaboration, user interface, knowledge integration, and system design (2025 PDF [6]). However, a major limitation to using LLMs is the need for task-specific datasets and fine-tuning for strong performance on desired tasks (2020 PDF [1]). Additionally, these models may make detection of automated coordinated inauthentic activity more difficult, potentially leading to increased threats such as online harassment and disinformation campaigns (2023 PDF [4]).
