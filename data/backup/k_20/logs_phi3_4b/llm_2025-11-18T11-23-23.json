Abstract—Ever since the Turing Test was proposed in the 1950s, humans have explored the mastering of language intelligence by machine.. Language is essentially a complex, intricate system of human expressions governed by grammatical rules. It poses a significant challenge to develop capable artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language.\n\n[8] 1304.1083v1.pdf (1989)\n. Solution of these two sub-problems is critical for rule based effons to model human cognition because algorithms implementing a solution to each of these two sub-problems are typically invoked every time a rule with quantitative representation of uncenainty fires. If these algorithms lack psychological validity, simulation errors will tend to accumulate and compound as rules fire. . A recent psychological experiment evaluated a number of different solutions to these problems (Shultz, Zelazo, &\n\n[9] 1304.1082v1.pdf (1990)\nA study of human reasoning under uncertainty suggests two different strategies for explaining probabilistic reasoning specially attuned to human thinking: The first, qualitative belief propagation, traces the qualitative effect of evidence through a belief network from one variable to the next.

Although it is widely acknowledged that much of human knowledge is uncertain, it is in the field of artificial intelligence that research on the representation and management of uncertainty in rule based reasoning has been focused (Kanal & Lemmer, 1986; Hink & Woods, 1987). Most of the work on uncertainty in artificial intelligence has so far been normative, stressing issues of mathematical correctness and effectiveness. .

Due to its great performance in handling different applications such as general natural language tasks and domain-specific ones, LLMs are increasingly used by individuals with critical information needs, such as students or patients.

  "model_output": "The mechanisms, strengths, and limitations of arguments for human oversight in critical AI systems have been discussed across various periods and contexts. The origins of the concept can be traced back to the 1950s with the proposal of the Turing Test as a benchmark for assessing intelligence in machines [7]. This test remains a significant objective in AI evolution, serving as a critical tool to evaluate the performance of AI models and identify current system limitations [1]. Expert systems (ES), knowledge-based systems that simulate human expertise, were one of the earlier research fields in Artificial Intelligence (AI) [2]. ES are designed to solve specific domain problems, and while they possess strengths such as probabilistic 'deduction' and nonmonotonic reasoning, their basic limitation is building expert systems with heuristic and empirical knowledge rather than deep knowledge [2]. Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained substantial interest in recent years. These models have demonstrated great performance across various applications, raising the promise that they could be AGI [1]. However, evaluation of LLMs is crucial for understanding their strengths and weaknesses and improving human-computer interaction [1]. Recent work has emphasized the importance of trustworthy AI (TAI), ensuring that AI systems are developed in ways that are lawful, ethical, and robust both from a technical and sociotechnical perspective [4]. TAI necessitates understanding the areas where such models may be abused and how these abuses can be prevented [4]. In terms of limitations, supervised models significantly outperform zero-shot models in terms of performance. However, an increase in parameters does not necessarily guarantee a higher level of social knowledge in this particular scenario [1]. Moreover, human reasoning under uncertainty poses challenges for AI algorithms, and solutions to these problems are critical for rule-based systems to model human cognition effectively [8, 9]. Finally, the term \"Human-in-the-Loop\" indicates that humans can intervene in data agents' workflows, while \"Self-Correcting\" refers to an agent's ability to automatically identify and correct errors within the workflow through reflection [6].
