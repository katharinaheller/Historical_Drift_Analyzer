Abstract—Ever since the Turing Test was proposed in the 1950s, humans have explored the mastering of language intelligence by machine.. Language is essentially a complex, intricate system of human expressions governed by grammatical rules. It poses a significant challenge to develop capable artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language.\n\n[2] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\n. Chief amongst these is the remarkable simplicity of the system combined with its very wide scope, much wider than the great majority of artificial intelligence systems, with the possible exception of unified theories of cognition such as Soar (Laird et al., 1987; Rosenbloom et al., 1993) and ACT-R (Anderson and Lebiere, 1998). . Like those two systems, the development of the SP system was inspired by the writings of Allen Newell, putting the case for greater breadth and depth in theories of co\n\n[1] 0712.3329v1.pdf (2007)\n. In some cases, a machine may display properties that we equate with human intelligence, in such cases it might be \"Innumerable tests are available for measuring intelligence, yet no one is quite certain of what intelligence is, or even just what it is that the available tests are measuring.\" — R. L. Gregory . [Gre98] reasonable to describe the machine as also being intelligent. . In other situations this view is far too limited and anthropocentric.\n\n[3] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n. Within the scope of AI, the Turing Test, a widely recognized test for assessing intelligence by discerning if responses are of human or machine origin, has been a longstanding objective in AI evolution. It is generally believed among researchers that a computing machine that successfully passes the Turing Test can be considered as intelligent. . Consequently, when viewed from a wider lens, the chronicle of AI can be depicted as the timeline of creation and evaluation of intelligent models and\n\n[6] 1304.1083v1.pdf (1989)\n. Although it is widely acknowledged that much of human knowledge is uncertain, it is in the field of artificial intelligence that research on the representation and management of uncertainty in rule based reasoning has been focused (Kanal & Lemmer, 1986; Hink & Woods, 1987). Most of the work on uncertainty in artificial intelligence has so far been normative, stressing issues of mathematical correctness and effectiveness. . The approach taken in this paper is not normative, but descriptive. . I\n\n[2] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\n. There is, of course, a wide variety of existing database systems that exhibit varying degrees and kinds of intelligence and it is reasonable to ask what may be gained by creating yet another system in that domain.. In brief, the attractions of the SP model in this connection are that: • It provides an extraordinarily simple yet versatile format for representing knowledge that facilitates the seamless integration of different kinds of knowledge. . The SP theory is an abstract model of any syste\n\n[2] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\nThat said, most applications that have been developed to date have a 'declarative' flavour and the ways in which the system may be applied to arithmetic or other mathematical operations have not yet been explored in any depth (but see Wolff ). This has a bearing on how the system may be developed for database applications, as will be discussed in Section 7. . Many problems in artificial intelligence are known to be intractable if one wishes to obtain the best possible answer. . But if one is con\n\n[1] 0712.3329v1.pdf (2007)\n.
