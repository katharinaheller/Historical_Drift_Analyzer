Abstract—Ever since the Turing Test was proposed in the 1950s, humans have explored the mastering of language intelligence by machine.. Language is essentially a complex, intricate system of human expressions governed by grammatical rules. It poses a significant challenge to develop capable artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language.\n\n[6] A Survey on Large Language Model-based Agents for Statistics and Data Science.pdf (2025)\n. For example, DS-1000 (Lai et al. 2023) provides a large-scale benchmark of 1000 realistic problems spanning seven core Python data science libraries, with execution-based multi-criteria evaluation and mechanisms to reduce memorization bias.

The system is Turing-equivalent in the sense that it can model the workings of a universal Turing machine but, unlike the universal Turing machine and equivalent models such as Lamda Calculus or Post's Canonical System, it has much more to say about the nature of 'intelligence' (Wolff, 1999a). The entire theory is based on principles of minimum length encoding pioneered by Ray Solomonoff and others (see Li and Vit´anyi ). . •\n\n[1] 0712.3329v1.pdf (2007)\n. The issues that continue to draw debate are the questions such as whether the tests test only a part or a particular type of intelligence, or whether they are somehow biased towards a particular group or set of mental skills. Great effort has gone into dealing with these issues, but they are difficult problems with no easy solutions. . Somewhat disconnected from this exists a parallel debate over the nature of intelligence in the context of machines. . While the debate is less politically char\n\n[8] D14-1162.pdf (2014)\n. In this work we argue that the two classes of methods are not dramatically different at a fundamental level since they both probe the underlying co-occurrence statistics of the corpus, but the efficiency with which the count-based methods capture global statistics can be advantageous.\n\n[1] 0712.3329v1.pdf (2007)\n. Ideally we would like to be able to measure the intelligence of a wide range of systems; humans, dogs, flies, robots or even disembodied systems such as chat-bots, expert systems, classification systems and prediction algorithms. [Joh92, Alb91]. One response to this problem might be to develop specific kinds of tests for specific kinds of entities; just as intelligence tests for children differ to intelligence tests for adults.\n\n[2] 2210.07321v4.pdf (2023)\nAdditional Key Words and Phrases: machine learning, artificial intelligence, neural networks, trustworthy AI, machine generated text, transformer, text generation, threat modeling, cybersecurity, disinformation, generative AI Since the release of GPT-2 and subsequent explosion of high-quality Transformer-based NLG models, there has been only one general survey on detection of machine generated text.
