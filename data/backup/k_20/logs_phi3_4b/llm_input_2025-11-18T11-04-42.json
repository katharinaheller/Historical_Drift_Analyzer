Since our goal is to produce interpretations of probabilistic reasoning that are more compatible with human reasoning styles, we started out with an empirical study of human strategies for uncertain reasoning.

Within the scope of AI, the Turing Test, a widely recognized test for assessing intelligence by discerning if responses are of human or machine origin, has been a longstanding objective in AI evolution.

Even in a probabilistic setting, deterministic qualitative relations are likely to play a significant role in definitions, accounting relations, and constraints (for instance, in constrained opti mization problems.

For example, Neufeld and Poole rely on the distinction be tween deterministic (implication) and probabilistic (confirmation) relations in their application of qual itative probability to default reasoning.

A major strength of the SP system is its support for probabilistic 'deduction' in one step or via chains of reasoning, abductive reasoning, and nonmonotonic reasoning with default values (Wolff, 1999b).\n\n[1] 1304.1082v1.pdf (1990)\nWhile there is ample evidence that normatively appealing probabilistic and decision theoretic schemes are poor models of human reasoning under uncertainty (e.g. Kahneman et a/. 1982), there is surprisingly little experimental evidence that the rule-based alternatives, such as certainty factors or fuzzy logic, are any better as descriptive models.

To summarize, the major contributions of this work are as follows: • The most complete survey of machine generated text detection to date, including previously omitted feature-based work and findings from recent contemporary research.. • The first detailed review of the threat models enabled by machine generated text, at a critical juncture where NLG models and tools are rapidly improving and proliferating. . • .

Indeed, the ability to de rive stronger qualitative conclusions from networks containing deterministic relations is ultimately due to the extra independencies sanctioned by the func tional constraints. Specification of deterministic variables in proba bilistic network representations was introduced by Shachter for numeric influence diagrams. . The hybrid representation scheme presented here extends the qualitative probabilistic network (QPN) formal ism to accommodate determin istic relations.\n\n[3] 1304.1081v1.pdf (1990)\n. In corporating these rules in a hybrid representation scheme results in a language more expressive and powerful than would be obtained from the simple union of its deterministic and probabilistic compo nents. The advantage of a functional relation is that the arguments of the function completely determine (hence the term deterministic) its value. . Any other variables added to the argument list would be su perfluous. . In contrast, introducing additional con ditioning variables to a conditiona\n\n[3] 1304.1081v1.pdf (1990)\n. Because neither relation subsumes the other, special treat ment of deterministic variables for reasoning about synergy is required for soundness if the special in terpretation of deterministic synergy is adopted. The question, then, is what inference rules are sanc tioned for probabilistic and deterministic variables and combinations. . Let us focus on the operation of reducing c in the network fragment of Figure 7. . If both c and d are probabilistic, the QPN update rule dictates the new syne\n\n[3] 1304.1081v1.pdf (1990)\n.

Given a set of random variables RVs, skeleton/2 first probabilistically chooses an undi rected graph Skel, then essential_graph/3 proba bilistically chooses an essential graph EG with immoralities Imms by adding arrows to Skel. bn/3 is then defined to probabilistically choose a particular BN from the equiva lence class of BNs defined by EG. . It is more natural to de fine a prior over essential graphs, but we extended the prior to be over BNs to compare with our previous experiments. . Althoug\n\n[3] 1304.1081v1.pdf (1990)\n. The foregoing analysis has demonstrated that aug menting QPNs to identify and exploit functional de pendencies can strengthen inference in hybrid net works of deterministic and probabilistiC variables. Moreover, much of the improvement can be real ized by simple modifications to existing graphical inference rules.\n\n[7] 2201.05273v4.pdf (2022)\n. mRASP2 applied contrastive learning to minimize the representation gap of similar sentences Text summarization is the process of condensing text into a brief summary that retains key information from the source text.

To motivate the approach, they introduced a probabilistic form for multi-task solving, i.e., p(output|input, task) (similar approaches have been adopted in ), which predicts the output conditioned on the input and task information. To model this conditional probability, language text can be naturally employed as a unified way to format input, output and task information. . In this way, the process of solving a task can be cast as a word prediction problem for generating the solution text.\n\nAnswer the refined query using only the context above. Use numeric citations.
