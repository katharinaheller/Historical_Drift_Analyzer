By analogy, such an emergent pattern has close connections with the phenomenon of phase transition\n\n[1] 0712.3329v1.pdf (2007)\nIn this paper we approach this problem in the following way: We take a number of well known informal definitions of human intelligence that have been given by experts, and extract their essential features.

Within the scope of AI, the Turing Test, a widely recognized test for assessing intelligence by discerning if responses are of human or machine origin, has been a longstanding objective in AI evolution.

This rather naive way of performing machine translation has quickly become competitive with the state-of-the-art, and this raises serious doubts about whether understanding a sen tence requires anything like the internal symbolic expressions that are manipulated by using inference rules.
