A significant takeaway from previous attempts is the paramount importance of AI evaluation, which serves as a critical tool to identify current system limitations and inform the design of more powerful models.

A popular speculation is that emergent abilities might be partially attributed to the evaluation setting for special tasks (e.g., the discontinuous evaluation metrics): when evaluation metrics are altered accordingly, the sharpness of the emergent ability curve would disappear.

By presenting a broad characterization of GPT-3's strengths and weaknesses, including these limitations, we hope to stimulate study of few-shot learning in language models and draw attention to where progress is most needed.

With the growing variety of text generation applications and datasets, there are several advantages of automatic evaluation: it is potentially much cheaper and quicker than human evaluation, and it is repeatable. Therefore, we mainly concentrate on automatic evaluation metrics for text generation in this part. .

We list th\n\n[3] 2201.05273v4.pdf (2022)\n.

For example, to generate reading materials for kids, we would like to guide the output stories to be safe, educational and easily understandable by children.\n\n[1] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n. Furthermore, the ongoing evolution of LLMs has also presented novel aspects for evaluation, thereby challenging existing evaluation protocols and reinforcing the need for thorough, multifaceted evaluation techniques. While existing research such as Bubeck et al. claimed that GPT-4 can be seen as sparks of AGI, others contest this claim due to the human-crafted nature of its evaluation approach. . This paper serves as the first comprehensive survey on the evaluation of large language models. .\n\n[3] 2201.05273v4.pdf (2022)\n. We began with introducing three key aspects when applying PLMs to text generation, based on which the main content of our survey is divided into three sections from the view of input representation learning, model architecture design, and parameter optimization.
