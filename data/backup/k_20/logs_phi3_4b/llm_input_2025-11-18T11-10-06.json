Never infer missing event years. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number.

You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nCompare and contrast the main theoretical perspectives on summarize the emergence of ethical ai frameworks over the decades., grounding historical claims only in explicit snippet content.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] 2210.07321v4.pdf (2023)\nThird, guided by the EU Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI and research community efforts, we present our survey with sociotechnical and human-centric considerations integrated throughout, focusing not only on NLG systems and machine text detection technologies, but on the humans who will be exposed to both text generation and detection systems in daily life.

Although these results, in and of themselves, may not ap pear earth-shattering, they do highlight an im portant point: outsiders (i.e., people other than the system's designers) were able to investigate and experimentally validate a knowledge engi neering exercise.

In general, scaling law (often measured by language modeling loss) describes predictable performance relation with the potential effect of diminishing returns, while emergent abilities (often measured by task performance) are unpredictable but very profitable once such abilities actually emerge.

While this is a significant achievement, the energy cost of creating such a model is still nontrivial, and repeated efforts to replicate a model of this size will only amplify the growing compute footprint of these LLMs. We believe the entire AI community — academic researchers, civil society, policymakers, and industry — must work together to develop clear 125M 6.0e−4 0.5M 350M 3.0e−4 0.5M 1.3B . 2.0e−4 1M 2.7B 1.6e−4 1M 6.7B . 1.2e−4 2M 13B 1.0e−4 4M 30B 1.0e−4 4M 66B 0.8e−4 2M 175B 1.2e−4 2\n\n[1] 2210.07321v4.pdf (2023)\n.

Chief amongst these is the remarkable simplicity of the system combined with its very wide scope, much wider than the great majority of artificial intelligence systems, with the possible exception of unified theories of cognition such as Soar (Laird et al., 1987; Rosenbloom et al., 1993) and ACT-R (Anderson and Lebiere, 1998). .
