Even in a probabilistic setting, deterministic qualitative relations are likely to play a significant role in definitions, accounting relations, and constraints (for instance, in constrained opti mization problems.

This propagation algorithm is an alternative to the graph reduction algorithms of Wellman for inference in qualitative probabilistic networks. . It is based on a qualitative analysis of intercausal reason\n\n[1] 1304.1081v1.pdf (1990)\n. This suggests that it would be generally useful to admit both strict and non-strict qualitative relations, carefully distinguish ing them and maintaining this information through network transformations.

Within the scope of AI, the Turing Test, a widely recognized test for assessing intelligence by discerning if responses are of human or machine origin, has been a longstanding objective in AI evolution.

Since our goal is to produce interpretations of probabilistic reasoning that are more compatible with human reasoning styles, we started out with an empirical study of human strategies for uncertain reasoning. This provided us with the inspiration for the design of two new and contrasting modes of explaining probabilistic reasoning, namely qualitative belief propagation and scenario-based reasoning. .
