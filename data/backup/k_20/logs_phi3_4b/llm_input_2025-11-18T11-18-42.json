Never infer missing event years. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number.

You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3.

Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train.. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously.

Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are extremely powerful machine learning models that achieve excellent performance on difficult problems such as speech recognition and visual object recognition..

So, while neural networks are related to conventional statistical models\n\n[8] 2303.18223v16.pdf (2025)\nFurthermore, word2vec was proposed to build a simplified shallow neural network for learning distributed word representations, which were demonstrated to be very effective across a variety of NLP tasks. These studies have initiated the use of language models for representation learning (beyond word sequence modeling), having an important impact on the field of NLP. . • Pre-trained language models (PLM).\n\n[6] 2201.05273v4.pdf (2022)\n. Such a statistical approach is known to suffer from the data sparsity issue, and a number of smoothing methods have been developed to alleviate this problem so as to better estimate unobserved term occurrences. Still, word tokens are used as the basic representation units in these approaches, which leads to the issue that similar tokens cannot be easily mapped with each other. .

With this unified approach, we can compare the effectiveness of different transfer learning objectives, unlabeled data sets, and other factors, while exploring the limits of transfer learning for NLP by scaling up models and data sets beyond what has previously been considered.

Many kinds of knowledge that are outside the scope of the relational model can be accommodated in the SP system and, as we shall see, it overcomes the weaknesses of the relational model in representing hierarchical structures. At the same time, it can accommodate the relational model when that is required.\n\n[2] 3641289.pdf (2024)\nIn the work of Honovich et al., they conducted a review of current factual consistency evaluation methods and highlighted the absence of a unified comparison framework and the limited reference value of related scores compared to binary labels.\n\n[1] NatureDeepReview.pdf (2025)\n. Although deep learning and simple reasoning have been used for speech and handwriting recognition for a long time, new paradigms are needed to replace rule-based manipulation of symbolic expressions by operations on large vectors101.. ■ Figure 5 | A recurrent neural network and the unfolding in time of the computation involved in its forward computation.\n\n[7] 1409.3215v3.pdf (2014)\nIn this work, we showed that a large deep LSTM, that has a limited vocabulary and that makes almost no assumption about problem structure can outperform a standard SMT-based system whose vocabulary is unlimited on a large-scale MT task. The success of our simple LSTM-based approach on MT suggests that it should do well on many other sequence learning problems, provided they have enough training data. .
