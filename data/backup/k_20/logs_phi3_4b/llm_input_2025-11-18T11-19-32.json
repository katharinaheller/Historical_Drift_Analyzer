In this paper we approach the problem of defining machine intelligence as follows: Section 2 overviews well known theories, definitions and tests of intelligence that have been developed by psychologists. Our objective in this section is to gain an understanding of the essence of intelligence in the broadest possible terms. .

Section 3 takes these key ideas an\n\n[6] 1304.1083v1.pdf (1989)\n. Although it is widely acknowledged that much of human knowledge is uncertain, it is in the field of artificial intelligence that research on the representation and management of uncertainty in rule based reasoning has been focused (Kanal & Lemmer, 1986; Hink & Woods, 1987). Most of the work on uncertainty in artificial intelligence has so far been normative, stressing issues of mathematical correctness and effectiveness. . The approach taken in this paper is not normative, but descriptive. . I\n\n[5] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n. Within the scope of AI, the Turing Test, a widely recognized test for assessing intelligence by discerning if responses are of human or machine origin, has been a longstanding objective in AI evolution. It is generally believed among researchers that a computing machine that successfully passes the Turing Test can be considered as intelligent. . Consequently, when viewed from a wider lens, the chronicle of AI can be depicted as the timeline of creation and evaluation of intelligent models and\n\n[4] 1304.1082v1.pdf (1990)\n.

In its overall abstract structure, the SP system is conceived as a system for unsupervised learning—and capabilities in this area have now been demonstrated in the SP70 computer model (Wolff, 2003c, 2002b).

It is generally agreed upon that authentic intelligence equips us with reasoning capabilities, enables us to test hypotheses, and prepares for future eventualities. . In particular, Artificial Intelligence (AI) researchers focus on the development of machine-based intelligence, as opposed",
