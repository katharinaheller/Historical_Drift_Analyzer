  "prompt_final_to_llm": "You are a rigorous AI researcher. Analyze mechanisms, methodologies, and implications over time. Event years may only be used if explicitly present in the snippet text. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nAnalyze the mechanisms, strengths, and limitations of state the main principles of trustworthy ai presented in the corpus., noting origins only when explicitly stated.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] 2210.07321v4.pdf (2023)\nAs such, trustworthy AI in the context of NLG necessitates understanding the areas where such models may be abused, and how these abuses may be prevented (either with detection technologies, moderation mechanisms, government legislation, or platform policies).

  "model_output": "The main principles of trustworthy AI, as presented in the provided corpus, can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. Prevention and mitigation of abuse: The importance of understanding where AI systems, particularly Natural Language Generation (NLG) models, might be abused and developing mechanisms to prevent such misuse [1]. This includes detection technologies, government legislation, and platform policies. 2. Human-centric considerations: Integration of sociotechnical factors and a focus on the humans who will interact with both text generation and detection systems daily [1]. 3. Unintended or dual-use applications: Recognition that unintended or dual-use applications of AI systems should be considered, and steps taken to prevent and mitigate their potential for harm [1]. 4. Evaluation of AI systems: The critical role of AI evaluation in identifying current system limitations and informing the design of more powerful models [2]. Regarding the origins of these principles, they are primarily derived from the EU Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI [1]. References:\n[1] 2210.07321v4.pdf (2023)\n[2] 3641289.pdf (2024)"
