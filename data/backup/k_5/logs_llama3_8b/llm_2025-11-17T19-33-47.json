You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3.

  "model_output": "The analysis, definition, strengths, and limitations of AI can be understood using the provided context snippets [1], [2], and [3]. Defining Artificial Intelligence:\n- According to [1], there is a general agreement among researchers that authentic intelligence equips us with reasoning capabilities, enables us to test hypotheses, and prepares for future eventualities. However, the context does not provide an explicit definition of AI. Mechanisms of AI:\n- The Turing Test, proposed in [1], is a widely recognized method for assessing intelligence by discerning if responses are of human or machine origin. In this test, a machine that successfully passes can be considered as intelligent ([1]). - Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant interest in both academic and industrial domains due to their capabilities to solve diverse tasks [1]. They are believed by some to be AGI in the current era ([1]). Strengths of AI:\n- GPT-3, discussed in [2], demonstrates a broad characterization of its strengths and capabilities in various tasks, though it should not be seen as a rigorous or meaningful benchmark in itself [2]. Limitations of AI:\n- The context from [2] presents a study that highlights the limitations of GPT-3, such as hallucinations, biases, and lack of common sense knowledge. - According to [3], there is only one general survey on detection of machine generated text, which suggests a gap in research on addressing AI limitations related to disinformation and cybersecurity threats. Implications over time:\n- The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark for evaluating AI (1950s; described in 2024 PDF [1]) and remains an influential concept in the field. - Large language models like GPT-3 have gained substantial interest and raised promise that they could be AGI in this era ([1]). - The limitations of LLMs, such as hallucinations and biases, are being studied to stimulate further research on few-shot learning in language models ([2]). - There is a recognized need for addressing AI limitations related to disinformation and cybersecurity threats, but the context does not provide evidence of specific historical events or timelines (described in 2023 PDF [3], event year not stated).
