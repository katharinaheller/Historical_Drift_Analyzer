  "prompt_final_to_llm": "You are a comparative analyst. Compare major frameworks or schools of thought, specifying explicit historical information only when stated in the provided snippets. Never infer missing event years. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nCompare and contrast the main theoretical perspectives on summarize the notion of general intelligence versus narrow ai in the corpus., grounding historical claims only in explicit snippet content.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] 0712.3329v1.pdf (2007)\n.

  "model_output": "Comparison and Contrast of General Intelligence and Narrow AI Notion:\n\nThe corpus provides insights into the theories surrounding general intelligence and narrow AI, with a focus on machine intelligence. 1. Definitions of human intelligence:\n   - (2007) [1] The paper discusses various informal definitions of human intelligence provided by experts, setting the foundation for defining machine intelligence. However, it does not specify any particular definition. 2. Measuring Intelligence:\n   - (2007) [1] The authors emphasize the need to establish the fundamentals of intelligence measurement applicable to various systems, recognizing the difficulty in developing a general notion of intelligence for machines. - (2024) [2] The Turing Test is presented as a widely recognized method for evaluating machine intelligence, with passing the test indicating an intelligent machine. 3. Formalization of Intelligence:\n   - (2007) [1] The authors propose mathematically formalizing essential features from well-known definitions of human intelligence to create a general measure of machine intelligence. They believe this equation captures the concept of machine intelligence in the broadest reasonable sense. 4. Relation between Universal Intelligence and Human Intelligence:\n   - (2007) [1] The paper acknowledges the complex intellectual, social, and political history of human intelligence and suggests that the current work aims to explore universal intelligence's relationship with mainstream views on human intelligence.
