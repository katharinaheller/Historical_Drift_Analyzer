Provide a precise definition, clarify theoretical foundations, and explain how interpretations evolved across time and publications. Use event years ONLY if explicitly stated in the snippets. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nDefine define cognitive architectures and describe their relevance to ai research., describe its theoretical foundations, and explain how definitions evolved historically across publications.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n.

  "model_output": "Cognitive architectures refer to comprehensive models of human intelligence that aim to explain and emulate various aspects of human cognition, such as perception, learning, problem-solving, and decision-making, within artificial systems [2]. These models are essential in AI research as they serve as a framework for designing intelligent machines. Theoretical foundations of cognitive architectures can be traced back to works by Allen Newell, who argued for greater breadth and depth in theories of cognition [2]. His ideas inspired the development of systems like Soar (Laird et al., 1987; Rosenbloom et al., 1993) and ACT-R (Anderson & Lebiere, 1998), which share similar goals with cognitive architectures [2]. Historically, the concept of cognitive architectures evolved through time. The Turing Test, proposed in the 1950s, was an early benchmark for assessing intelligence by discerning if responses are of human or machine origin [1]. Over time, researchers have focused on creating machine-based intelligence to emulate human intelligence more closely [1]. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention due to their capability to solve diverse problems and raise the possibility that they could be Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) in this era [1]. However, it's worth noting that the debate on whether LLMs possess authentic intelligence is still ongoing, as evaluating AI performance and understanding its limitations are critical aspects of AI research [1].
