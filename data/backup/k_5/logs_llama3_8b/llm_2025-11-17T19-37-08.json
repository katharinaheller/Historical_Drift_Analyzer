  "prompt_final_to_llm": "You are a comparative analyst. Compare major frameworks or schools of thought, specifying explicit historical information only when stated in the provided snippets. Never infer missing event years. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nCompare and contrast the main theoretical perspectives on summarize the emergence of ethical ai frameworks over the decades., grounding historical claims only in explicit snippet content.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] 2210.07321v4.pdf (2023)\nThird, guided by the EU Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI and research community efforts, we present our survey with sociotechnical and human-centric considerations integrated throughout, focusing not only on NLG systems and machine text detection technologies, but on the humans who will be exposed to both text generation and detection systems in daily life.

  "model_output": "The emergence of ethical AI frameworks over the decades can be traced through three key perspectives: the Turing Test, the development of generative AI, and the concept of Trustworthy AI (TAI). 1. The Turing Test ([3]) is a longstanding objective in AI evolution, first proposed in the 1950s (described in [3]). The test aims to assess if responses are of human or machine origin, serving as a benchmark for intelligent models. 2. Generative AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs), has gained increasing recognition in recent years ([2]). This development is not associated with any specific event year within the provided context. 3. Trustworthy AI (TAI) is a more recent focus, emphasizing lawful, ethical, and robust development of AI systems ([1]). The EU ethics guidelines for TAI were presented in 2023 ([1]), highlighting concerns about unintended or dual-use applications and the prevention of abuse. Comparatively, the Turing Test marks the early stages of AI evolution, while generative AI development gained momentum more recently. Trustworthy AI frameworks emerged most recently as a response to the increased recognition and potential risks associated with the advancement of AI technologies.
