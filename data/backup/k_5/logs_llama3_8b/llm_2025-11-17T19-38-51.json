Provide a precise definition, clarify theoretical foundations, and explain how interpretations evolved across time and publications. Use event years ONLY if explicitly stated in the snippets. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nDefine explain the concept of heuristic search as described in the corpus., describe its theoretical foundations, and explain how definitions evolved historically across publications.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] 1910.10683v4.pdf (2023)\nOur heuristics are inspired by past work on using Common Crawl as a source of data for NLP: For example, Grave et al. also filter text using an automatic language detector and discard short lines and Smith et al.;.

  "model_output": "Artificial Intelligence's heuristic search is a strategy employed to find acceptable solutions within a given timeframe, without guaranteeing optimal solutions [2]. This approach focuses on hill climbing and related techniques that concentrate the search in productive areas while retaining flexibility to escape from local optima [2]. The theoretical foundation of heuristic search lies in exploring the search space intelligently by employing heuristics, or problem-specific hints, to guide the search process. These hints can help identify promising solutions and prune unpromising ones, thus reducing computational complexity [3]. Historically across publications, the concept of heuristic search has evolved from its introduction in the 1950s as a means for problem-solving in artificial intelligence [1]. In the early 2010s, research focused on understanding how to generate meaning and represent it using word statistics found in corpora during unsupervised methods for learning word representations [3]. Subsequently, by 2018, there was an emphasis on applying heuristics for filtering text data when creating large-scale datasets for NLP tasks [1].
