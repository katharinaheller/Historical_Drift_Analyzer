Never infer missing event years. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number.

The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6.

  "model_output": "Comparative Analysis of Theoretical Perspectives on Computational Linguistics and AI Research\n\nThe context provided offers insights into two major theoretical perspectives on computational linguistics' influence on artificial intelligence research: Log Bilinear Models (LBM) and Natural Language Generation (NLG). 1. Log Bilinear Models (LBM):\n   - Origin of regularities in word vectors has remained opaque [1] (event year not stated; described in 2014 PDF [1]). - A new global log bilinear regression model is proposed to make explicit the model properties needed for such regularities to emerge in word vectors [1]. - The evolution of LLMs has made an important impact on the entire AI community, contributing to the development of powerful AI chatbots like ChatGPT [2] (event year not stated; described in 2025 PDF [2]). 2. Natural Language Generation (NLG):\n   - Significant potential for abuse in scaling and targeting of existing attacks using NLG models is recognized [4] (event year not stated; described in 2023 PDF [4]). - Much of the research on NLG-enabled influence operations focuses on AI-generated news articles, while sociological data suggest that machine-generated comments may play a significant role as well [4]. In terms of historical context, the earliest reference provided dates back to 1989 when the focus was on uncertainty in artificial intelligence research rather than computational linguistics or AI chatbots [5]. However, insufficient evidence is available regarding the development and influence of NLG prior to 2023.
