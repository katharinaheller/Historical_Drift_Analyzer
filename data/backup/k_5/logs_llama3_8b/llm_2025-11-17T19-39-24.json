Provide a precise definition, clarify theoretical foundations, and explain how interpretations evolved across time and publications. Use event years ONLY if explicitly stated in the snippets. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nDefine summarize how symbolic representation enables inference in ai., describe its theoretical foundations, and explain how definitions evolved historically across publications.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] NatureDeepReview.pdf (2025)\n.

  "model_output": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has evolved over time, with symbolic representation and inference being key components. The Turing Test [3], proposed in the 1950s, served as a benchmark for assessing intelligence by distinguishing between human and machine responses. Symbolic representation in AI involves creating internal representations that mirror the real world or the problem at hand. These symbolic expressions can then be manipulated using inference rules to derive new knowledge or solve problems [1]. (Insufficient evidence about theoretical foundations is provided.)\n\nInference schemes, as described in 1990 [4], operate on a belief network representation of knowledge, while scenario-based explanations are based on scenario trees. Each path from root to an end node represents a sequence of events, making understanding scenarios easier when presented as coherent causal stories. The evolution of symbolic representation and inference has been reflected in the development of machine learning models. Representation learning [1] allows machines to automatically discover the necessary representations for detection or classification from raw data. Modern text summarization approaches [2], based on Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), employ either extractive or abstractive methods, demonstrating a shift towards more complex and sophisticated techniques.
