  "model_output": "**Artificial Intelligence Bias**\n\nBias in Artificial Intelligence can be introduced through data and model assumptions. The bias may manifest as a preference for certain attributes, such as race, gender, or age, which is undesirable in many text generation tasks [1]. Theoretical foundations suggest that these biases are hidden within model components like word embeddings and attention heads [1]. One approach to mitigating gender bias in word embeddings involves swapping gendered terms during training data preparation [1]. In order to produce more factual summaries, some studies have proposed evaluation metrics or correction methods for preserving factuality [1]. In the context of Language Models (LLMs), maintaining factuality is crucial, as it ensures that the information or answers provided by the model align with real-world truths and verifiable facts [2]. For instance, addressing English bias or other biases is essential for multilingual applications to achieve impartiality and neutrality [2]. The origins of deep contextualized word representations can be traced back to 2018, where a new type of representation was introduced that models complex characteristics of word use and how these uses vary across linguistic contexts [3]. However, there is insufficient evidence in the provided context about the historical evolution of definitions related to AI bias. [EVID1 Revised]:\n- [1] \"Texts generated by PLMs may exhibit unwanted biases towards certain attributes, such as favoring specific races, genders, or age groups, which is undesirable for text generation tasks.
