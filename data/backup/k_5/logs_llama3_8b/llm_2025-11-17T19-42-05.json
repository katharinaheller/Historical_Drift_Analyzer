  "prompt_final_to_llm": "You are a comparative analyst. Compare major frameworks or schools of thought, specifying explicit historical information only when stated in the provided snippets. Never infer missing event years. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nCompare and contrast the main theoretical perspectives on explain the emergence of hybrid ai models in the corpus., grounding historical claims only in explicit snippet content.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] A Survey on Large Language Model-based Agents for Statistics and Data Science.pdf (2025)\n.

  "model_output": "The emergence of hybrid AI models can be traced back to the 2014 introduction of a global logbilinear regression model that combined properties from two major model families, as described in [2]. This model was designed to capture fine-grained semantic and syntactic regularities using vector arithmetic. In recent years, there has been increasing recognition of the potential and rise of generative AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) or vision language models (VLMs), in the field of data science and analysis [1]. However, explicit historical information about the emergence of these specific hybrid models is not provided in the given context. Moreover, the context does not provide enough evidence to determine if supervised or zero-shot models were predominantly used during the emergence of hybrid AI models. [3] discusses the significance of trustworthy AI (TAI) and machine generated text detection, while [4] highlights the challenges in reasoning tasks for intelligent AI models, but neither document provides direct insights into the historical development of hybrid AI models.
