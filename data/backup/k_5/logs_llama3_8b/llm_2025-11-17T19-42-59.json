Provide a precise definition, clarify theoretical foundations, and explain how interpretations evolved across time and publications. Use event years ONLY if explicitly stated in the snippets. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6.

  "model_output": "Cognitive plausibility in AI modeling refers to the degree to which AI systems are designed to mimic human cognitive processes and behavior, with the aim of creating more intelligent and flexible machines [1]. The theoretical foundations of cognitive plausibility can be traced back to the Turing Test, proposed in the 1950s as a benchmark for assessing intelligence by distinguishing responses between humans and machines [1]. Over time, the definition of cognitive plausibility has evolved to incorporate a wider range of human-like cognitive abilities, such as learning, problem-solving, reasoning, and understanding context [2]. This evolution is evident in the development of the Soar theory, introduced in 1988, which aims to create AI systems that possess a comprehensive set of human-like cognitive processes [2]. Recent research has emphasized the importance of evaluating AI systems to identify current system limitations and inform the design of more powerful models [1]. For instance, large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention due to their impressive performance in various tasks. However, there is ongoing debate about whether LLMs represent artificial general intelligence (AGI) [1]. The technological evolution of GPT-series models has been a significant focus of recent research, with the development and improvement of these models progressing rapidly over the past years [4]. Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it is worth noting that the Soar theory also provides insights into database applications, especially those requiring a measure of human-like 'intelligence' [2].
