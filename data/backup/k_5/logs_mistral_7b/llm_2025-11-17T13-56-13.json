Provide a precise definition, clarify theoretical foundations, and explain how interpretations evolved across time and publications. Use event years ONLY if explicitly stated in the snippets. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nDefine summarize limitations of defining intelligence highlighted in the corpus., describe its theoretical foundations, and explain how definitions evolved historically across publications.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] 0712.3329v1.pdf (2007)\n.

  "model_output": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) Definitions and Evolution:\n\nIn the 2007 paper [1], the authors aim to define machine intelligence by analyzing well-known theories, definitions, and tests of human intelligence provided by psychologists. The goal is to establish a general and abstract notion of intelligence applicable to arbitrary systems and contexts beyond humans. The limitations of defining intelligence are highlighted in the paper, emphasizing the difficulty of developing an abstract and highly general concept of intelligence due to its complex nature ([1]). In particular, they discuss the challenges associated with measuring the intelligence of diverse systems in a meaningful way. Regarding theoretical foundations, the authors extract essential features from informal definitions of human intelligence given by experts and mathematically formalize them to produce a general measure of machine intelligence [1]. They argue that their equation captures the concept of machine intelligence in the broadest reasonable sense ([1]). However, the relationship between universal intelligence and mainstream views on human intelligence is explored further in the paper. Historically, the authors mention Binet's test as a landmark achievement in measuring children's intelligence, which was found to be a good predictor of their academic performance [1]. Although not explicitly stated, they acknowledge the rich intellectual, social, and political history of human intelligence ([1]). However, insufficient evidence is provided regarding the evolution of definitions across publications. References:\n[1] 0712.3329v1.pdf (2007)"
