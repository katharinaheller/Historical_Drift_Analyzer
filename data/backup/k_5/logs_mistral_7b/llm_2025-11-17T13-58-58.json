Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number.

You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6.

  "model_output": "The Turing Test, proposed as a benchmark for assessing intelligence by discerning human-like responses from machine-generated ones [1], has been a significant evaluation approach in AI evolution since its conception. The test's primary aim is to determine if a computing machine can be considered intelligent when it successfully passes the Turing Test [1]. Although task performance and the Turing Test are both evaluation approaches for AI, there seems to be a preference among end-users for reliable code generated by Language Learning Models (LLMs) that can pass test cases rather than selecting a better code with fewer errors between two failed ones [2]. However, more research is needed to understand the working mechanism of LLMs and the emergence of intelligence in them [2]. A study proposes a new evaluation setting to enlarge the resolution of task metrics and make task performance more predictable [2]. Despite these recent efforts, there remains a need for fundamental research about the working mechanism of LLMs [2]. Honovich et al. conducted a review of current factual consistency evaluation methods and highlighted the absence of a unified comparison framework and the limited reference value of related scores compared to binary labels [1]. In the comparison of AI models, studies often compare primarily with GPT-3 and report performance in accuracy [4]. For instance, when evaluating the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC) task in the SuperGLUE benchmark, they follow a multiple-choice question format [4].
