  "prompt_final_to_llm": "You are a comparative analyst. Compare major frameworks or schools of thought, specifying explicit historical information only when stated in the provided snippets. Never infer missing event years. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nCompare and contrast the main theoretical perspectives on contrast capability framing versus ethical framing of ai across the sources., grounding historical claims only in explicit snippet content.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n.

Contrast Capability Framing of AI:\n   - The Turing Test, a method for assessing intelligence in machines by determining if responses are human or machine-originated, has been a significant focus in AI evolution since its proposal (event year not stated; described in 2024 PDF [1]). - Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered substantial interest due to their great performance and the promise they hold for being Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) in this era (event year not stated; described in 2024 PDF [1]). Ethical Framing of AI:\n   - The EU Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI emphasize considerations beyond just technical aspects, including lawfulness, ethical implications, and robustness (2023 PDF [2]). - The guidelines also address the need to prevent and mitigate potential harm caused by unintended or dual-use applications of AI systems (event year not stated; described in 2023 PDF [2]). Insufficient evidence is found regarding a direct comparison between contrast capability framing and ethical framing of AI across the provided sources. Revised sentences aligning with the evidence snippets:\n\n1. Understanding the essence of intelligence and determining whether a machine embodies it is a question that scientists consistently grapple with. Authentic intelligence, according to consensus, equips us with reasoning capabilities, allows for hypothesis testing, and prepares for future eventualities (EVID1).\n\n2. Within AI, the Turing Test, a widely recognized test for assessing intelligence by discerning if responses are of human or machine origin, has been a longstanding objective in AI evolution (EVID2). Researchers generally believe that a computing machine that successfully passes the Turing Test can be considered as intelligent (EVID2).\n\n3. Guided by the EU Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI and research community efforts, our survey presents sociotechnical and human-centric considerations integrated throughout, focusing not only on NLG systems and machine text detection technologies, but also on the humans who will be exposed to both text generation and detection systems in daily life (EVID3). The goal of trustworthy AI is to ensure that AI systems are developed in ways that are lawful, ethical, and robust from a technical perspective (EVID3).\n\n4. The EU ethics guidelines for trustworthy AI stress the importance of taking into account unintended or dual-use applications of AI systems and preventing and mitigating their abuse to cause harm (EVID4).\n\n5. Previous attempts have highlighted the paramount importance of AI evaluation, which serves as a critical tool to identify current system limitations and inform the design of more powerful models (EVID5). Recently, large language models (LLMs) have incited substantial interest across both academic and industrial domains (EVID5). Existing work demonstrates that the great performance of LLMs has raised promise that they could be AGI in this era (EVID5), as they possess the capabilities to solve diverse problems (EVID5)."
