Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number.

You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3.

  "model_output": "The mechanisms, strengths, and limitations of context completeness affecting evaluation quality have been discussed in the corpus. Specifically, [1] (2020) discusses the limitations of GPT-3, though it does not explicitly state how context completeness affects evaluation quality. [2] (2022) highlights the need for summarization models to produce more factual summaries and mentions the importance of controlling the output text, which could be related to context completeness. [3] (2018) discusses the representation of different types of contextual information in biLMs, showing that syntactic information is better represented at lower layers while semantic information is captured at higher layers (Sec. 5.3). This suggests a role for context completeness, but no direct link to evaluation quality is made. [4] (2024) summarizes the importance of AI evaluation and discusses the great performance of large language models (LLMs), raising the possibility that they could be AGI (Section 6). However, it does not explicitly discuss context completeness or its effect on evaluation quality. Insufficient evidence is available to directly answer how context completeness affects evaluation quality in a comprehensive manner from the provided corpus.

By outlining a comprehensive overview of GPT-3's strengths and weaknesses, including limitations, we aim to inspire further research into few-shot learning in language models, particularly focusing on areas where advancements are most crucial. A general sense of the overall findings can be gleaned from Figure 1.3, which compiles various tasks (though it should not be interpreted as a rigorous or definitive benchmark). [EVID1]\n\n2. To produce more factual summaries in summarization models, some studies have proposed evaluation metrics or correction methods to measure and revise generated text for preserving accuracy. Controllability is essential in text generation, where many applications require precise control over the output text. For instance, when generating reading materials for children, we desire to direct the output stories to be safe, educational, and easily comprehensible. [EVID2]\n\n3. Section 5.3 examines the various types of contextual information captured in biLMs and employs two intrinsic evaluations to demonstrate that syntactic information is better represented at lower layers, while semantic information is captured at higher layers, a finding consistent with MT encoders. It also reveals that our biLM consistently offers richer representations than CoVe. Additionally, we analyze the sensitivity of ELMo's inclusion in the task model (Section 5.2), the training set size (Section 5.4), and its visualization. [EVID3]\n\n4. Section 6 summarizes existing tasks in various fields, providing valuable insights into the successes and failures of LLMs, offering a foundation for future research. Regarding evaluation, we outline current protocols and summarize novel approaches. Furthermore, we discuss potential challenges in the future. [EVID4]\n\n5. Previous efforts have underscored the importance of AI evaluation as a vital tool for identifying existing system limitations and guiding the development of more powerful models. The significant interest generated by large language models (LLMs) across academic and industrial domains is indicative of this. As evidenced by existing work, LLMs have shown great potential to perform various tasks, raising hope that they could be AGI in this era. However, it should be noted that the performance of LLMs does not guarantee AGI. [EVID5]"
