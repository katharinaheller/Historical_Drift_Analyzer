  "prompt_final_to_llm": "You are a domain expert in Artificial Intelligence. Provide a precise definition, clarify theoretical foundations, and explain how interpretations evolved across time and publications. Use event years ONLY if explicitly stated in the snippets. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nDefine describe how reinforcement learning is portrayed in the corpus., describe its theoretical foundations, and explain how definitions evolved historically across publications.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] 2210.07321v4.pdf (2023)\n.

  "model_output": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a method used in Artificial Intelligence, focusing on agents that learn to make decisions by performing actions within an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward [3]. In this learning setup, the agent interacts with its environment by executing actions and observing the results, aiming to find a policy (a mapping from states to actions) that maximizes the expected cumulative reward. The theoretical foundations of RL can be traced back to the seminal work by Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto in the 1990s [4]. The authors proposed the concept of Temporal Difference (TD) learning, which allows agents to learn from sparse rewards using bootstrapping techniques. In recent years, reinforcement learning has evolved significantly. One key development is the use of meta-learning (also known as Learning to Learn) [3]. Meta-learning refers to the ability of a model to develop a broad set of skills and pattern recognition abilities during training, which can then be applied rapidly at inference time to recognize or adapt to the desired task. Another significant evolution is the application of reinforcement learning in the context of natural language processing (NLP) [1]. Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) has been used to address reward sparsity and mode collapse problems in GAN-based text generation, allowing for the learning of an optimal reward function and generation policy. The Transformer architecture, currently representing the state-of-the-art in NLP tasks, employs a multi-head attention mechanism that facilitates the understanding and generation of natural language [1]. Lastly, representation learning has been recognized as a fundamental set of methods for machine learning, allowing machines to automatically discover representations needed for detection or classification from raw data [2].
