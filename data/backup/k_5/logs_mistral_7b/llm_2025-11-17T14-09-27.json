Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number.

You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nAnalyze the mechanisms, strengths, and limitations of compare deterministic and probabilistic ai models discussed in the sources., noting origins only when explicitly stated.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n.

  "model_output": "The mechanisms, strengths, and limitations of comparing deterministic and probabilistic AI models have been discussed in multiple sources. The origins of these discussions are not explicitly stated. Regarding the mechanisms, it appears that both deterministic and probabilistic models operate differently. Deterministic models follow strict rules to make decisions or predictions, while probabilistic models consider uncertainty and make predictions based on probability distributions [3]. In terms of strengths, the context suggests that large language models (LLMs), which can be seen as a type of probabilistic AI model, have demonstrated great performance in solving diverse tasks [1]. On the other hand, there is insufficient evidence to determine the strengths of deterministic AI models from the provided context. As for limitations, it's stated that large language models like GPT-3 have certain weaknesses and that progress is needed in specific areas to improve them [2]. However, the context does not provide enough information about the limitations of deterministic AI models. [1] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n[2] 2005.14165v4.pdf (2020)\n[3] 1304.1082v1.pdf (1990)"
