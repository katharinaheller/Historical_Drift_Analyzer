  "prompt_final_to_llm": "You are a domain expert in Artificial Intelligence. Provide a precise definition, clarify theoretical foundations, and explain how interpretations evolved across time and publications. Use event years ONLY if explicitly stated in the snippets. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nDefine explain the concept of heuristic search as described in the corpus., describe its theoretical foundations, and explain how definitions evolved historically across publications.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] 1910.10683v4.pdf (2023)\nOur heuristics are inspired by past work on using Common Crawl as a source of data for NLP: For example, Grave et al. also filter text using an automatic language detector and discard short lines and Smith et al.;.

  "model_output": "Heuristic Search is a method used in Artificial Intelligence (AI) to find solutions within a search space, often used in problem-solving and decision-making tasks. It emphasizes the use of strategies or rules of thumb (heuristics) to guide the search process and improve efficiency by focusing on promising areas without exhaustively exploring the entire search space [2]. The theoretical foundations of heuristic search are based on the idea that not all paths in a search space are equally likely to lead to an optimal solution. Heuristics help to prioritize and direct the search towards more promising areas, reducing the number of solutions that need to be evaluated [1][2]. The concept of heuristic search has evolved over time. Early works focused on developing specific heuristics for particular problems, such as the Minimum-Distance Heuristic used in pathfinding algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm or A* search [3]. More recent works, like the Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) model, use heuristics to filter and process large amounts of unstructured data for various natural language processing tasks [1]. Definitions of heuristic search have evolved to encompass a broader range of techniques that prioritize promising areas in the search space while maintaining flexibility to escape from local optima [2]. In modern AI, heuristics are often combined with other methods such as machine learning to further improve efficiency and effectiveness [1][3].
