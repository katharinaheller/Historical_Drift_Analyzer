  "prompt_final_to_llm": "You are a domain expert in Artificial Intelligence. Provide a precise definition, clarify theoretical foundations, and explain how interpretations evolved across time and publications. Use event years ONLY if explicitly stated in the snippets. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nDefine describe how knowledge inference operates within expert systems., describe its theoretical foundations, and explain how definitions evolved historically across publications.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] Expert_Systems.pdf (2016)\n.

  "model_output": "Knowledge Inference within Expert Systems:\n\nDefinition and Theoretical Foundations:\n(1970s; described in 2016 PDF [1]) An expert system is a knowledge-intensive software that can perform tasks requiring human expertise [1]. These systems are built upon two main components - a knowledge base and an inference engine. The inference engine makes inferences by determining how the system reasons using IF–THEN rules in the knowledge base [1]. The process of moving forward from known facts to conclusions that follow them is called forward chaining, while backward chaining refers to inferring the premises needed to deduce a given conclusion [1]. Evolution Across Publications:\n(event year not stated; described in 2016 PDF [1]) The concept of expert systems emerged under the umbrella of Artificial Intelligence (AI) around mid-1970s and was transformed into an established branch of computer science as soon as convincing successes were attained [1]. As a result, various expert system building tools or shells have been developed to facilitate their construction process, known as knowledge engineering [1].
