  "model_output": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) paradigms were significantly redefined after 2010 with the emergence and advancement of neural networks, particularly deep learning techniques. The theoretical foundations of these modern AI paradigms are rooted in distributed representation, end-to-end solutions, and parallel computation. Distributed representation was first introduced in [1], where the concept of word vectors was proposed to learn effective features for text data. This approach was used to build a unified solution for various tasks, including language modeling (Fig. 1). Parallel computation plays a crucial role in reducing sequential computation and forms the basis for extensions such as the Extended Neural GPU, ByteNet, and ConvS2S [3]. These advancements use convolutional neural networks as their fundamental building blocks. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) were powerful machine learning models that achieved excellent performance on complex problems such as speech recognition and visual object recognition by performing arbitrary parallel computation for a modest number of steps [4]. An unexpected example of the power of DNNs is their ability to sort N N-bit numbers using only 2 hidden layers of quadratic size. More recent developments in AI involve language models, with OpenAI's GPT series (GPT-1, GPT-2, GPT-3, and potentially GPT-4) representing significant milestones [1]. These models have been built upon the foundation laid by recurrent neural networks (RNN), with the Transformer architecture playing a key role in their development. Unfortunately, there is insufficient evidence in the provided context to discuss how AI definitions evolved historically across publications before 2014.
