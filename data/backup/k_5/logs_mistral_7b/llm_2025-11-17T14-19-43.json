Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nAnalyze the mechanisms, strengths, and limitations of describe how temporal context influences ai evaluation., noting origins only when explicitly stated.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n.

  "model_output": "The mechanisms, strengths, and limitations of AI evaluation have evolved over time, particularly in the context of large language models (LLMs). The Turing Test, a critical benchmark for assessing intelligence by discerning human or machine responses, has been a longstanding objective in AI evolution, as stated in [1] (2024) and alluded to in [1] (2024) and [3] (2020). The test's significance is that a machine passing it can be considered intelligent ([1] (2024)). The importance of AI evaluation, especially for LLMs, is highlighted due to their wide applicability in various domains. Evaluating LLMs helps us understand their strengths and weaknesses, as demonstrated by the PromptBench benchmark that shows current LLMs are sensitive to adversarial prompts ([1] (2024)). Moreover, trustworthy AI, including NLG models, necessitates understanding areas of potential abuse and prevention strategies such as detection technologies, moderation mechanisms, government legislation, or platform policies ([2] (2023)). However, the context does not provide evidence on how temporal context influences AI evaluation directly. Instead, it highlights the historical development of the Turing Test ([1] (2024)) and the importance of evaluation for understanding LLMs' strengths and weaknesses ([1] (2024), [3] (2020)).
