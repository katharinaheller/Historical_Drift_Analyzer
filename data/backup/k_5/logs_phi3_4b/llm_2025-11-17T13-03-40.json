  "prompt_final_to_llm": "You are a rigorous AI researcher. Analyze mechanisms, methodologies, and implications over time. Event years may only be used if explicitly present in the snippet text. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nAnalyze the mechanisms, strengths, and limitations of summarize ai ethics and trustworthiness concerns in the 2020s sources., noting origins only when explicitly stated.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n.

  "model_output": "In the 2020s, the discussion surrounding AI ethics and trustworthiness concerns has expanded significantly, with various key aspects being addressed [1][2]. The following analysis will outline the mechanisms, strengths, and limitations based on the provided context snippets:\n\nMechanisms:\n(event year not stated; described in 2024 PDF [1]) Researchers are employing newly constructed scenarios, tasks, and metrics to evaluate AI models, focusing on eight critical aspects: toxicity, stereotype bias, adversarial and out-of-distribution robustness, robustness to adversarial demonstrations, privacy, machine ethics, and fairness [1]. (event year not stated; described in 2023 PDF [2]) The EU Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI emphasize the need for sociotechnical and human-centric considerations when developing NLG systems, with a focus on both the technology and the humans exposed to it in daily life [2]. (event year not stated; described in 2023 PDF [2]) The EU guidelines also stress the importance of considering unintended or dual-use applications of AI systems and taking steps to prevent and mitigate abuse that could cause harm [2]. Strengths:\n(event year not stated; described in 2024 PDF [1]) The expanded evaluation criteria for trustworthiness allow for a more holistic approach to assessing AI models, ensuring they are developed with the necessary safeguards to address various concerns. (event year not stated; described in 2023 PDF [2]) The EU guidelines provide a framework for developing trustworthy AI that prioritizes lawfulness, ethics, and robustness from both technical and human perspectives. Limitations:\nInsufficient evidence to identify specific limitations based on the provided context snippets. Implications over time:\n(event year not stated; described in 2024 PDF [1]) As large language models (LLMs) continue to develop, there is potential for them to be considered AGI in this era. The importance of AI evaluation will remain critical for identifying current system limitations and informing the design of more powerful models. (event year not stated; described in 2023 PDF [2]) Adherence to guidelines such as the EU Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI will be crucial for ensuring that AI systems are developed responsibly, with an emphasis on preventing and mitigating potential abuse.
