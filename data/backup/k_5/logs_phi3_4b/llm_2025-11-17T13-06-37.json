  "prompt_final_to_llm": "You are a comparative analyst. Compare major frameworks or schools of thought, specifying explicit historical information only when stated in the provided snippets. Never infer missing event years. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nCompare and contrast the main theoretical perspectives on how did ai concepts shift from rule-based expert systems to modern approaches according to the corpus?, grounding historical claims only in explicit snippet content.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] Expert_Systems.pdf (2016)\n.

  "model_output": "Comparative Analysis on the Shift from Rule-Based Expert Systems to Modern AI Approaches:\n\nIn the 1970s, expert systems emerged as a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI), marking the beginning of the shift from rule-based expert systems ([1], [2]). These systems were designed to emulate human expertise by incorporating specialized knowledge elicited from domain experts ([1]). Expert systems found their popularity and application in various fields, such as engineering, chemistry, medicine, industry, and others, during the early 1980s when they moved out of research laboratories ([1]). The construction process of these expert systems, referred to as knowledge engineering, involved acquiring knowledge from periodicals, books, or interviews with human experts ([1]). The general architecture of an expert system consisted of a user interface, explanation facility, working memory, and inference engine ([1]). However, research on the representation and management of uncertainty in rule-based reasoning was primarily focused in the field of AI during this period ([2]). By the mid-1980s to late 1990s, there is no explicit evidence in the provided context that signifies a significant shift from rule-based expert systems to modern AI approaches. The focus seems to be on refining and improving the efficiency of these systems rather than transitioning to new paradigms ([1]).
