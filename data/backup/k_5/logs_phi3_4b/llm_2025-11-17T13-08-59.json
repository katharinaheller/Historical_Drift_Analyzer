Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3.

  "model_output": "**Cognitive Architectures**\n\nCognitive architectures are frameworks that aim to explain the organization and workings of intelligent systems, including both humans and artificial agents [2]. These models serve as a foundation for understanding how intelligence emerges and operates within these systems. They attempt to integrate various cognitive processes such as perception, learning, memory, reasoning, and problem-solving [2]. The relevance of cognitive architectures to AI research lies in their potential to guide the design of intelligent machines that mimic human cognition. By understanding the underlying structures of intelligence, researchers can develop more sophisticated artificial systems capable of learning, planning, and adapting in complex environments [1]. **Theoretical Foundations**\n\nOne significant cognitive architecture is the SP theory, which was developed with the goal of integrating and simplifying a broad range of concepts in computing and cognitive science, particularly within AI [2]. This theory provides an attractive model for database applications that require a measure of human-like \"intelligence.\" The SP system shares similarities with other unified theories of cognition such as Soar and ACT-R, both of which were inspired by the writings of Allen Newell [2]. **Historical Evolution**\n\nIn the 1950s (described in 2024 PDF [1]), the Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark for evaluating AI systems. This test assesses whether responses are of human or machine origin, and a machine that successfully passes this test is considered intelligent [1]. The evolution of cognitive architectures can be seen as an ongoing effort to create and evaluate intelligent models, with recent developments focusing on large language models (LLMs) [1]. As demonstrated by existing work, LLMs have garnered significant interest due to their impressive performance in diverse tasks, raising the possibility that they could represent AGI in this era [1]. The importance of AI evaluation has been highlighted throughout the history of AI research as a critical tool for identifying current system limitations and informing the design of more powerful models [1]. **References**\n[1] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n[2] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)"
