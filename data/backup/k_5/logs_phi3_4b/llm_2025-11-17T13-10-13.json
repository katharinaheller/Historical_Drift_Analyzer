  "prompt_final_to_llm": "You are a comparative analyst. Compare major frameworks or schools of thought, specifying explicit historical information only when stated in the provided snippets. Never infer missing event years. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nCompare and contrast the main theoretical perspectives on compare symbolic reasoning and statistical learning paradigms in the sources., grounding historical claims only in explicit snippet content.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] 1304.1082v1.pdf (1990)\n.

Qualitative Belief Propagation and Scenario-Based Reasoning (described in 1990 PDF [1]) are two new modes of explaining probabilistic reasoning, developed based on an empirical study of human strategies for uncertain reasoning. This approach aims to make interpretations of probabilistic reasoning more compatible with human reasoning styles. 2. Transfer Learning for NLP (described in 2023 PDF [2]) focuses on comparing the effectiveness of different transfer learning objectives, unlabeled data sets, and other factors. The primary goal is not to propose new methods but instead to provide a comprehensive perspective on where the field stands, surveying, exploring, and empirically comparing various approaches in NLP. 3. Text Summarization (described in 2022 PDF [3]) mainly consists of extractive and abstractive summarization techniques. Extractive summarization selects a subset of sentences from the source text to form the summary, while abstractive summarization generates the summary by generating new sentences. 4. Machine Translation (described in 2025 PDF [4]) raises doubts about the need for internal symbolic expressions that are manipulated using inference rules during everyday reasoning. Instead, it is more compatible with the view that everyday reasoning involves many simultaneous analogies. Insufficient evidence was found regarding comparisons between these paradigms or explicit differences in historical development between Symbolic Reasoning and Statistical Learning Paradigms (described in 1990 PDF [5]).
