Provide a precise definition, clarify theoretical foundations, and explain how interpretations evolved across time and publications. Use event years ONLY if explicitly stated in the snippets. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6.

  "model_output": "**Artificial Intelligence - Approaches to Knowledge Acquisition**\n\nThe process of condensing text into a brief summary, known as Text Summarization, has evolved significantly over time in the realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Two mainstream approaches based on Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) are extractive and abstractive summarization [1]. Extractive summarization selects relevant sentences from the source text to form a summary, while abstractive summarization generates a summary by understanding the content and generating new sentences. The theoretical foundations of Knowledge Engineering emerged during the 1980s, when expert systems moved out of research laboratories and were applied in various fields such as engineering, chemistry, medicine, and industry [2]. Knowledge-based expert systems contained knowledge acquired from periodicals, books, or interviews with human experts. Over time, the scale of models used for text summarization has increased significantly. By combining insights from exploration and a large dataset called the \"Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus\" (C4), state-of-the-art results have been achieved in various tasks, including summarization, question answering, and text classification [3]. Summarizing existing tasks and evaluation methods, discussing success and failure cases of Language Model Large (LLM) models, and exploring novel evaluation approaches are some recent developments in the field [4]. However, insufficient evidence is available to detail how these definitions have evolved historically across publications. **References**\n[1] 2201.05273v4.pdf (2022)\n[2] Expert_Systems.pdf (2016)\n[3] 1910.10683v4.pdf (2023)\n[4] 3641289.pdf (2024)"
