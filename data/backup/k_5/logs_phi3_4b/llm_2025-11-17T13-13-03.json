  "prompt_final_to_llm": "You are a comparative analyst. Compare major frameworks or schools of thought, specifying explicit historical information only when stated in the provided snippets. Never infer missing event years. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nCompare and contrast the main theoretical perspectives on summarize debates about ai autonomy and control in the 2020s., grounding historical claims only in explicit snippet content.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] 2201.05273v4.pdf (2022)\n. mRASP2 applied contrastive learning to minimize the representation gap of similar sentences Text summarization is the process of condensing text into a brief summary that retains key information from the source text.

  "model_output": "Comparison and Contrast of Theoretical Perspectives on AI Autonomy and Control in the 2020s:\n\n1. Text Summarization Approaches:\n   - Mainstream approaches to text summarization are either extractive or abstractive ([1], [4]). Extractive summarization selects a subset of sentences from the source text, while abstractive summarization generates the summary. 2. Machine-Generated Text Detection and Trustworthy AI:\n   - A comprehensive survey of machine-generated text detection has been presented, including contemporary research ([2]). The importance of considering trustworthy AI (TAI) in this context is emphasized. 3. AI Evolution and the Turing Test:\n   - The Turing Test is a widely recognized test for assessing intelligence by distinguishing human from machine responses, with researchers believing that passing it signifies intelligent behavior ([3]). 4. Debates on AI Intelligence:\n   - Debates over AI intelligence are multi-faceted, discussing issues such as bias and the scope of tests measuring intelligence ([4]). The nature of universal intelligence in relation to human and machine intelligence is also explored.
