  "prompt_final_to_llm": "You are a domain expert in Artificial Intelligence. Provide a precise definition, clarify theoretical foundations, and explain how interpretations evolved across time and publications. Use event years ONLY if explicitly stated in the snippets. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nDefine explain the importance of context completeness for retrieval-based reasoning., describe its theoretical foundations, and explain how definitions evolved historically across publications.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\n.

  "model_output": "**Artificial Intelligence Definition and Evolution of Context Completeness for Retrieval-Based Reasoning**\n\nContext Completeness for retrieval-based reasoning refers to the degree to which an AI system can accurately interpret and utilize context in a comprehensive manner, enabling it to effectively retrieve, process, and apply relevant information. This concept is crucial as it enhances the system's ability to understand and respond appropriately to user queries or complex scenarios. Theoretical Foundations:\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018) highlights that ontologies and semantic retrieval of information play a significant role in achieving context completeness by providing structured knowledge representation and enabling the system to understand the relationships between entities, attributes, and concepts. Historical Evolution:\n[2] 1304.1082v1.pdf (1990) notes that the importance of explanations for users' understanding of AI systems has been recognized since the early days of expert systems and decision support systems. To foster wider acceptance, comprehensible explanations of probabilistic reasoning were deemed essential, paving the way for improved context completeness. The 1990 paper [2] also discusses the design of two new modes of explaining probabilistic reasoning: qualitative belief propagation and scenario-based reasoning, further emphasizing the importance of context completeness in AI systems.
