If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3.

  "model_output": "**Artificial Intelligence Interpretability Across Different Decades**\n\nThroughout the evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI), definitions and interpretations have undergone significant changes across different decades. The Turing Test, a benchmark for assessing machine intelligence by discerning responses between humans and machines, was proposed in the 1950s [3]. This test has been a crucial milestone in AI's development over the subsequent years. (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [3])\n\nThe Turing Test focuses on the ability of AI to mimic human-like intelligence, setting a standard for evaluating AI systems. In recent times, there has been an emphasis on AI evaluation as a critical tool for identifying system limitations and improving model designs [1]. (event year not stated; described in 2024 PDF [1])\n\nRecent developments have focused on large language models (LLMs) and their potential for generating AI that can perform complex tasks, even raising the possibility of them being Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the exact definition of intelligence remains a subject of ongoing research and debate. (event year not stated; described in 2025 PDF [2])\n\nIn an effort to define machine intelligence, Goertzel et al. [4] provided a comprehensive approach by overviews of existing theories, definitions, and tests of intelligence from psychology. Their work aimed to understand the essence of intelligence across various contexts, not just humans. (2007; described in 2007 PDF [4])\n\n**References**\n[1] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n[2] A Survey on Large Language Model-based Agents for Statistics and Data Science.pdf (2025)\n[3] 2303.18223v16.pdf (2025)\n[4] 0712.3329v1.pdf (2007)"
