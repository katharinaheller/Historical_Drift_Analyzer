  "prompt_final_to_llm": "You are an analytical historian of Artificial Intelligence. Describe how the concept evolved across time, highlighting paradigm shifts, milestones, and key theoretical transformations. Present findings in a coherent historical narrative ordered strictly by explicit *event years* found in the snippets. If a snippet provides no explicit event year, you MUST write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'. Never guess or estimate historical periods under any circumstances. Avoid enumeration; emphasize causal relations and conceptual transitions. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nTrace the historical development and evolution of describe the historical transition from gofai to machine learning. strictly through the explicit event years present in the snippets.

(1950s; described in 2025 PDF [5]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark for AI, initiating research into artificial intelligence that could simulate human-like conversation and cognitive abilities. 2. (event year not stated; described in 2020 PDF [1]) The development of supervised models marks an important step towards machine learning, with the training process focusing on learning from labeled data to predict outputs. 3. (event year not stated; described in 2023 PDF [2]) The introduction of transfer learning highlights a shift towards more efficient use of pre-trained models, particularly useful for data-scarce settings and improving generalization capabilities. 4. (event year not stated; described in 2023 PDF [3]) The discussion on threat modeling fundamentals shows that by considering attackers' objectives and capabilities, AI systems become more robust against potential threats, a key aspect of modern machine learning security. 5. (event year not stated; described in 2024 PDF [4]) The comparison between supervised models and zero-shot models demonstrates the superiority of supervised models in terms of performance, further emphasizing the importance of learning from data for AI systems. 6. (2025; described in 2025 PDF [5]) Julius (2025) facilitates data science education by enabling interactive workflows through natural language interaction, showcasing a new paradigm of machine learning-based agents in statistics and data science applications.
