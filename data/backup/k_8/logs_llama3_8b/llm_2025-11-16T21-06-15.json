Never infer missing event years. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number.

You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nCompare and contrast the main theoretical perspectives on outline the core subfields of ai mentioned in the corpus., grounding historical claims only in explicit snippet content.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n.

  "model_output": "The main theoretical perspectives and subfields of AI, as outlined in the provided corpus, can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Turing Test and Machine Intelligence** (event year not stated; described in 2024 PDF [1]) The Turing Test is a widely recognized benchmark for assessing intelligence by discerning if responses are of human or machine origin. It serves as a longstanding objective in AI evolution, with a computing machine that passes the test considered intelligent. This perspective emphasizes the evaluation and development of models to emulate human-like intelligence. 2. **Human Intelligence and Machine Intelligence Relationship** (event year not stated; described in 2007 PDF [2]) The paper explores universal intelligence, its relationship with human intelligence, and other proposed definitions of machine intelligence. It highlights the complexity of human intelligence, providing an overview that could be applicable to many systems. 3. **Binet Intelligence Test** (event year not stated; described in 1990 PDF [4]) The Binet intelligence test was developed to predict children's academic performance. Although it may not seem earth-shattering, this work demonstrates the importance of transparency and experimentation in AI, particularly in knowledge engineering. 4. **Large Language Models (LLMs) and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)** (event year not stated; described in 2024 PDF [1]) Large language models have garnered substantial interest due to their capability to solve diverse tasks and raise the promise that they could be AGI. Representation learning efficiency is crucial for modeling long documents, especially when generating long text. 5. **Trustworthy AI (TAI)** (event year not stated; described in 2023 PDF [3]) This perspective focuses on the survey of machine-generated text detection and the threat models enabled by natural language generation (NLG) tools. It provides a meaningful exploration of these topics through the lens of Trustworthy AI. In summary, the main theoretical perspectives on AI revolve around the Turing Test, human and machine intelligence relationships, historical Binet tests, large language models, and trustworthy AI.
