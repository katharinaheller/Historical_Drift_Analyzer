Provide a precise definition, clarify theoretical foundations, and explain how interpretations evolved across time and publications. Use event years ONLY if explicitly stated in the snippets. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nDefine define cognitive architectures and describe their relevance to ai research., describe its theoretical foundations, and explain how definitions evolved historically across publications.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n.

  "model_output": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) cognitive architectures are frameworks designed to model and simulate human-like intelligence within machines. These architectures aim to understand and replicate various aspects of cognition, such as perception, reasoning, learning, memory, and problem-solving [2]. The relevance of cognitive architectures to AI research lies in their potential for creating intelligent systems that can demonstrate human-like behavior by imitating the processes underlying human thought. This is crucial in achieving the longstanding objective of passing the Turing Test [1]. Historically, the development of cognitive architectures in AI research evolved from the pursuit of greater breadth and depth in theories of cognition [2]. In the 2000s, definitions and tests of intelligence developed by psychologists served as a foundation for approaching machine intelligence [5]. More recently, theories like the SP theory have been introduced with the aim of integrating and simplifying concepts in computing and cognitive science [2]. The current emphasis on large language models (LLMs) has led to new advancements in AI cognitive architectures. These models possess capabilities to solve diverse tasks and have raised the possibility that they could be considered Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) [1, 3, 4].
