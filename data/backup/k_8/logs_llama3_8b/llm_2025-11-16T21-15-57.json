Provide a precise definition, clarify theoretical foundations, and explain how interpretations evolved across time and publications. Use event years ONLY if explicitly stated in the snippets. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nDefine describe how ai systems learn from data as presented in the sources., describe its theoretical foundations, and explain how definitions evolved historically across publications.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] Expert_Systems.pdf (2016)\n.

  "model_output": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems learn from data primarily through supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning methods, as well as representation learning. The concept of AI systems learning from data was initially introduced with expert systems in the 1980s [1]. Expert systems are knowledge-based systems that can perform specific domain problems by utilizing human expertise. The general architecture of an expert system consists of a user interface, explanation facility, working memory, and an inference engine [1]. The Turing Test, proposed in the 1950s, has served as a benchmark for assessing AI systems' ability to mimic human intelligence by discerning whether responses are of human or machine origin [2, 6]. Passing the Turing Test implies that the system can be considered intelligent. In recent years, the rise of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) or vision-language models (VLMs) has gained recognition in data science and analysis, particularly for their potential to automate tasks requiring human expertise [3]. Representation learning is a set of methods used by machines to automatically discover the representations needed for detection or classification from raw data [4]. Human-centric considerations have become increasingly important in developing trustworthy AI systems, as guided by EU Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI [5]. This approach ensures that AI systems are developed in ways that are lawful, ethical, and robust from a technical and sociotechnical perspective.
