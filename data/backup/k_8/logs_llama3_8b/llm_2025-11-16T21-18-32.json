  "model_output": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) paradigms were significantly redefined after 2010, with the emergence and widespread adoption of Neural Networks. Neural networks are machine learning models that mimic the structure and function of the human brain's neurons to learn complex patterns in data [4][5]. The theoretical foundation of these neural networks lies in their ability to perform arbitrary parallel computation for a modest number of steps, making them powerful enough to solve difficult problems such as speech recognition and visual object recognition [4]. The evolution of AI paradigms involving neural networks can be traced back to the early 2010s. In 2013, a popular model architecture for estimating Neural Network Language Models (NNLM) was proposed using feedforward neural networks [5]. This work paved the way for numerous subsequent studies aimed at pushing the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures [3]. In 2014, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) were recognized as extremely powerful machine learning models due to their ability to perform complex computations and achieve excellent performance on challenging tasks [4]. Around the same time, recurrent neural networks (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent neural networks (GRU) became established as state-of-the-art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [3]. By 2017, the introduction of Transformer architecture enabled the development of more powerful models like GPT-1 and GPT-2 by OpenAI. These models can be considered as the foundation for subsequent developments such as GPT-3 and GPT-4 [1]. Furthermore, neural network approaches replaced rule-based manipulation of symbolic expressions by operations on large vectors for speech and handwriting recognition [2]. In summary, the redefinition of AI paradigms after 2010 was primarily driven by advancements in Neural Networks. These advancements were based on the foundation of performing arbitrary parallel computation, learning effective features for text data, reducing sequential computation, and establishing state-of-the-art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems [3][4].
