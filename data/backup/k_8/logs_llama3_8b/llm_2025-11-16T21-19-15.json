Never infer missing event years. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nCompare and contrast the main theoretical perspectives on explain the emergence of hybrid ai models in the corpus., grounding historical claims only in explicit snippet content.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] A Survey on Large Language Model-based Agents for Statistics and Data Science.pdf (2025)\n.

  "model_output": "Comparison of Theoretical Perspectives on the Emergence of Hybrid AI Models:\n\n1. (event year not stated; described in 2025 PDF [1]) The rise and potential of generative AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) or vision language models (VLMs), have gained increasing recognition in recent years. This trend can be seen as a shift towards hybrid AI models that combine the strengths of different AI branches. 2. (event year not stated; described in 2024 PDF [2]) The Turing Test, a benchmark for assessing machine intelligence, has been a longstanding objective in AI evolution. Researchers believe that passing the Turing Test indicates intelligent behavior in a computing machine. Recently, LLMs have gained significant interest due to their performance, raising discussions about their potential as AGI. 3. (2014; described in 2014 PDF [3]) The GloVe model, which leverages statistical information by training only on the nonzero elements in a word-word cooccurrence matrix, has demonstrated the capability to capture fine-grained semantic and syntactic regularities. This shows the potential for hybrid AI models that learn from large corpora to improve language understanding capabilities. 4. (insufficient evidence; described in 2023 PDF [4]) The context does not provide explicit information about the emergence of hybrid AI models. However, it mentions the significance of machine-generated text detection and threat models, which could be related to advancements in generative AI models like LLMs. References:\n[1] A Survey on Large Language Model-based Agents for Statistics and Data Science.pdf (2025)\n[2] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n[3] D14-1162.pdf (2014)\n[4] 2210.07321v4.pdf (2023)"
