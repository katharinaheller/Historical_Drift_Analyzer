  "model_output": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, including learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and perception. The theoretical foundations of AI are rooted in computer science, mathematics, psychology, linguistics, and philosophy. The limitations of defining AI have been explored through various theories and tests proposed by psychologists [1]. One key challenge is the development of an abstract and highly general notion of intelligence that can be applied to diverse systems [1]. The authors in [1] propose a mathematical formalization of essential features extracted from well-known informal definitions of human intelligence, aiming to create a general measure of intelligence for arbitrary machines. Historically, the Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark for AI, testing a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human [1]. However, the test has its limitations, such as the difficulty in defining what constitutes \"intelligent\" behavior and the potential for machines to pass the test through deception rather than true understanding [insufficient evidence]. The development of expert systems faced the limitation of building systems with heuristic and empirical knowledge, rather than deep knowledge that includes models of functional and causal relations underlying a problem [3]. Cooperative learning among multiple sources of knowledge (i.e., domain experts) remains a challenging problem [3]. In a separate line of research, the development of Turing-equivalent systems has focused on understanding the nature of 'intelligence' [2]. However, the connection between these theories and the general definition of machine intelligence is not explicitly addressed in the provided context.
