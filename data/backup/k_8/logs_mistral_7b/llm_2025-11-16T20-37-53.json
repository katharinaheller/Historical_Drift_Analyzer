  "prompt_final_to_llm": "You are an analytical historian of Artificial Intelligence. Describe how the concept evolved across time, highlighting paradigm shifts, milestones, and key theoretical transformations. Present findings in a coherent historical narrative ordered strictly by explicit *event years* found in the snippets. If a snippet provides no explicit event year, you MUST write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'. Never guess or estimate historical periods under any circumstances. Avoid enumeration; emphasize causal relations and conceptual transitions. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nTrace the historical development and evolution of provide a chronological overview of ai concepts from oldest to newest source. strictly through the explicit event years present in the snippets.

(event year not stated; described in 3641289.pdf [6]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark for assessing intelligence by discerning if responses are of human or machine origin. This test has been a longstanding objective in AI evolution, and it is generally believed among researchers that a computing machine that successfully passes the Turing Test can be considered as intelligent. 2. (event year not stated; described in 2303.18223v16.pdf [7]) The development of Expert Systems emerged with the aim to increase individual and social potential by preserving know-how, distributing knowledge more effectively, and improving performance of tasks that require expertise (I. M. Dokas and A. Alapetite, 2006 [1]). 3. (event year not stated; described in 0311031v1.pdf [2]) In the development of the SP theory, computer models were created to reduce vagueness and inconsistencies, verify the system's functioning according to expectations, and demonstrate its capabilities (Wolff, 2000). One such model, SP61, was developed which builds multiple alignments from New and Old patterns. 4. (event year not stated; described in 2303.18223v16.pdf [7]) In the past years, there has been significant progress in developing GPT models, with a focus on improving text generation tasks and generating content that adheres to original input facts. 5. (event year not stated; described in 2210.07321v4.pdf [4]) Since the release of GPT-2, there has been only one general survey on detection of machine generated text, but its scope is limited to methods targeting the specific detection of NLG models (Transformer-based). 6. (event year not stated; described in 1910.10683v4.pdf [5]) The rapid rate of progress and diversity of techniques in transfer learning can make it difficult to compare different algorithms, tease apart the effects of new contributions, and understand the space of existing methods for transfer learning. 7. (event year not stated; described in NatureDeepReview.pdf [8]) AI has shown remarkable achievements in various fields, such as image recognition, speech recognition, predicting drug molecule activity, analyzing particle accelerator data, reconstructing brain circuits, and predicting the effects of mutations in non-coding DNA on gene expression and disease.
