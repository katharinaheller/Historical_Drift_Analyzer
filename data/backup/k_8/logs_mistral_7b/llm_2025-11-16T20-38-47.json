Never infer missing event years. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number.

You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3.

  "model_output": "Comparison between the shift from rule-based expert systems to modern AI approaches, as depicted in the provided corpus:\n\nRule-Based Expert Systems (1970s - early 1980s) [2]\n1. Definition and emergence: Expert systems were one of the earlier research fields in Artificial Intelligence (AI), emerging around mid-1970s, as defined knowledge-intensive software systems designed to solve specific domain problems [2]. They behaved as artificial advisory systems for a particular problem domain [2]. 2. Structure: Expert systems contained specialized knowledge elicited from a domain expert [2]. The reasoning process was determined by the human expert [2]. These systems were initially built using classical expert system shells [2]. 3. Popularity and applications: After moving out of research laboratories during early 1980s, expert systems became more popular and found several application fields such as engineering, chemistry, medicine, industry, and many others [2]. 4. Knowledge engineering: The construction process of expert systems with specialized domain knowledge is defined as knowledge engineering [2]. Knowledge was acquired from periodicals, books, or through interviews with human experts [2]. Transition to Modern Approaches (1980s - Present) [1], [3], [4]\n1. Shift in approaches: The recent wave of work on Bayesian networks and other statistical models has moved away from strictly rule-based systems towards more adaptable solutions for Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems [1]. These statistical methods aimed to be more flexible across different domains compared to rule-based systems [1]. 2. Hidden Markov Models: Hidden Markov Models (HMM) have featured prominently in integrating statistical models with NLG systems, albeit past work has also included other models [1]. 3. Uncertainty management: While much of human knowledge is uncertain, the field of artificial intelligence started focusing on the representation and management of uncertainty in rule-based reasoning from the late 1980s [4]. This focus eventually led to more general approaches in system design [4]. Insufficient evidence was found for direct comparisons between the development timelines or specific milestones that led to the shift from expert systems to modern AI approaches.
