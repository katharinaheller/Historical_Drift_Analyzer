Provide a precise definition, clarify theoretical foundations, and explain how interpretations evolved across time and publications. Use event years ONLY if explicitly stated in the snippets.

You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3.

  "model_output": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field that focuses on developing intelligent machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, and decision-making [3]. One crucial aspect of AI is the use of symbolic representation for enabling inference. Symbolic representation involves using internal symbols or representations to represent knowledge and manipulate them according to inference rules [4]. This approach allows machines to perform complex tasks by combining simple symbols or rules, thus imitating human-like reasoning [1]. The theoretical foundations of symbolic AI are based on the idea that intelligence can be understood as a set of formal systems or logical structures that enable reasoning and problem-solving [4]. The evolution of symbolic representation in AI has been marked by significant advancements throughout history. Early works focused on developing expert systems, which were designed to solve specific problems by encoding human expertise into a set of rules [3]. In the 1980s and 1990s, there was a shift towards more flexible and general-purpose AI systems, such as the development of the Soar cognitive architecture [5]. More recently, there has been increased interest in hybrid approaches that combine symbolic and subsymbolic representation learning methods [1]. In contemporary AI research, symbolic representation is often used in conjunction with deep learning techniques for tasks like natural language processing (NLP) and machine translation [2]. For instance, the use of distributed representations allows machines to generalize to new combinations of learned features beyond those seen during training [1]. Additionally, composing layers of representation in a deep neural network can bring the potential for another exponential advantage [1].
