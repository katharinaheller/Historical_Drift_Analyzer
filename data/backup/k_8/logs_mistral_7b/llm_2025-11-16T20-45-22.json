  "model_output": "Artificial Intelligence systems, particularly rule-based systems, manage uncertainty through various methods as described historically across publications. The foundational concepts were established in the 1980s and evolved over time. In 1989, Kanal and Lemmer [1] introduced a descriptive approach to modeling propagation of uncertainty in rule-based reasoning. Their work focused on maximin summarizing, multiplication scaling, and Beckerman's modified certainty factor model for combining evidence across rules. The authors demonstrated that these methods could successfully simulate the data of human subjects in rule-based propagation of uncertainty. Similarly, Shultz et al. [1] conducted an experiment evaluating different solutions to critical sub-problems related to managing uncertainty in rule-based systems. Their research addressed the importance of ensuring that algorithms used in these systems are psychologically valid to avoid simulation errors accumulating and compounding as rules fire. While rule-based approaches were prevalent prior to the popularization of neural networks in the 1990s, statistical models like Hidden Markov Models (HMM) featured prominently [2]. These statistical methods aimed to be more adaptable to different domains than strictly rule-based systems. However, it's important to note that there is a lack of experimental evidence showing that rule-based approaches, such as certainty factors or fuzzy logic, are better descriptive models of human reasoning under uncertainty compared to probabilistic and decision theoretic schemes [3]. Additionally, there is insufficient evidence regarding the evolution of definitions of rule-based systems managing uncertainty beyond the works mentioned above.
