Provide a precise definition, clarify theoretical foundations, and explain how interpretations evolved across time and publications. Use event years ONLY if explicitly stated in the snippets. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nDefine explain the importance of context completeness for retrieval-based reasoning., describe its theoretical foundations, and explain how definitions evolved historically across publications.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] A Survey on Large Language Model-based Agents for Statistics and Data Science.pdf (2025)\n.

  "model_output": "**Artificial Intelligence and Context Completeness for Retrieval-Based Reasoning**\n\nContext Completeness for Retrieval-Based Reasoning refers to ensuring that a large language model (LLM)-based agent has access to sufficient context, including relevant code, external knowledge sources such as databases or knowledge graphs, and the ability to retrieve stored information [1]. This completeness is crucial for facilitating in-context learning and augmenting reasoning capabilities. Theoretical Foundations:\nThe Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, introduced by Lewis et al. in 2020, demonstrates a method where relevant code is first retrieved and then embedded within the context to facilitate in-context learning [1]. Similarly, the Knowledge Integration method proposed by Sun et al. builds on this concept, allowing LLM-based agents to access external knowledge sources [insufficient evidence for specific theoretical foundations beyond 2025]. Historical Evolution:\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, the importance of context completeness and its impact on reasoning have been recognized since the development of expert systems in the 1980s. The developers of these early systems were aware of the need for comprehensible explanations of computer-based reasoning to increase user acceptance [3]. Since then, research has focused on various aspects of reasoning, such as qualitative belief propagation and scenario-based reasoning, to better align with human reasoning styles [3]. In more recent years (2018), the concept of context completeness evolved to include not only the retrieval of relevant information but also probabilistic reasoning and pattern recognition within multiple alignment frameworks [2]. Modern approaches such as RAG and Knowledge Integration further advance this idea by leveraging advances in LLMs [1, insufficient evidence for specific theoretical foundations beyond 2025].
