Provide a precise definition, clarify theoretical foundations, and explain how interpretations evolved across time and publications. Use event years ONLY if explicitly stated in the snippets. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nDefine describe how reasoning and perception are integrated in intelligent agents., describe its theoretical foundations, and explain how definitions evolved historically across publications.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\n.

  "model_output": "Integrating reasoning and perception in intelligent agents has evolved over time, as depicted by the developments in various theories and methodologies. The following discussion provides a definition, theoretical foundations, and historical evolution of this concept based on the provided context snippets. **Definition:** Intelligent agents that integrate reasoning and perception are designed to process, understand, and respond to complex environments using a combination of cognitive functions such as probabilistic and exact forms of reasoning, unsupervised learning, fuzzy pattern recognition, best-match information retrieval, planning, problem solving, and others ([1], 2018). **Theoretical Foundations:** The SP theory is one such attempt to integrate and simplify a range of concepts in computing and cognitive science, with a particular emphasis on artificial intelligence. It provides a framework for processing knowledge that integrates various AI functions ([1], 2018). Additionally, large language models (LLMs) are being increasingly utilized to develop agents capable of planning, reasoning, reflection, multi-agent collaboration, user interface, and system design for data-centric problems ([2], 2025). **Historical Evolution:** The Turing Test was proposed in the 1950s as a benchmark for evaluating machine intelligence (event year not stated; described in 2007 PDF [3]). In the 1990s, there was an emphasis on producing interpretations of probabilistic reasoning that are more compatible with human reasoning styles, leading to the design of two new modes of explaining probabilistic reasoning: qualitative belief propagation and scenario-based reasoning ([4], 1990). More recent developments in LLMs have further enabled agents to access and interact with external knowledge sources, such as databases or knowledge graphs, to augment their reasoning capabilities ([2], 2024b). **References:**\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\n[2] A Survey on Large Language Model-based Agents for Statistics and Data Science.pdf (2025)\n[3] 0712.3329v1.pdf (2007)\n[4] 1304.1082v1.pdf (1990)"
