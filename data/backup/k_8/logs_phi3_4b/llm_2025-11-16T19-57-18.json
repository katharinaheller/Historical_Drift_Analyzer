  "prompt_final_to_llm": "You are an analytical historian of Artificial Intelligence. Describe how the concept evolved across time, highlighting paradigm shifts, milestones, and key theoretical transformations. Present findings in a coherent historical narrative ordered strictly by explicit *event years* found in the snippets. If a snippet provides no explicit event year, you MUST write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'. Never guess or estimate historical periods under any circumstances. Avoid enumeration; emphasize causal relations and conceptual transitions. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nTrace the historical development and evolution of trace key ai milestones across decades referenced in the corpus. strictly through the explicit event years present in the snippets.

Here's a historical narrative structured according to explicit event years found in the snippets:\n\n1. (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [5]) The Turing Test, a widely recognized test for assessing intelligence by discerning if responses are of human or machine origin, was proposed as a benchmark for AI evolution. 2. (event year not stated; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The concept of Bayesian Networks (BN) emerged, which allowed the definition of an SLD tree that refutes goals using logic programs and assigns probabilities to successful branches. 3. (event year not stated; described in 2023 PDF [3]) The development of Transformer-based models led to substantial progress on various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, including reading comprehension, question answering, textual entailment, and many others. This last paradigm has continued to advance based on new architectures and algorithms [RSR+19, LOG+19, YDY+19, LCG+19]. 4. (2023; described in 2025 PDF [6]) The launch of ChatGPT, a powerful AI chatbot developed based on Large Language Models (LLMs), attracted widespread attention and made an important impact on the entire AI community, revolutionizing the way we develop and use AI algorithms. 5. (event year not stated; described in 2024 PDF [5]) The rapid progress in AI led to a diverse range of techniques in various fields such as image recognition, speech recognition, drug molecule activity prediction, particle accelerator data analysis, brain circuit reconstruction, and non-coding DNA mutation effects prediction. 6. (event year not stated; described in 2025 PDF [8]) DS-1000 was introduced as a large-scale benchmark of 1000 realistic problems spanning seven core Python data science libraries, with execution-based multi-criteria evaluation and mechanisms to reduce memorization bias.
