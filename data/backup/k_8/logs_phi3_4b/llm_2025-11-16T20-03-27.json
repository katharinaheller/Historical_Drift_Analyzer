You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4.

  "model_output": "The mechanisms, strengths, and limitations of computational power on AI capabilities have been explored extensively over time. The Turing Test, a benchmark for assessing artificial intelligence by discerning if responses are of human or machine origin, was proposed in the 1950s [3]. Researchers generally believe that a machine passing this test can be considered intelligent [1]. Large language models (LLMs) have gained substantial interest recently due to their impressive performance. The importance of evaluating AI systems to identify current system limitations and inform the design of more powerful models has been emphasized [1]. LLMs possess the capabilities to solve diverse tasks, raising the question of whether they could be considered Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) in this era [1]. Studies have shown that the performance of neural language models is related to three major factors: model size (N), dataset size (D), and training compute (C) [3]. This power-law relationship has been crucial in advancing research on LLMs [3]. The rapid technical progress of LLMs has made an important impact on the entire AI community, with the launch of ChatGPT being a notable example [3]. However, it's essential to acknowledge that while LLMs have shown remarkable capabilities for zero- and few-shot learning, their overall results should not be seen as a rigorous or meaningful benchmark in themselves [2]. To stimulate further study of few-shot learning in language models, it is crucial to understand both the strengths and limitations of these models [2].
