Provide a precise definition, clarify theoretical foundations, and explain how interpretations evolved across time and publications. Use event years ONLY if explicitly stated in the snippets.

Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3.

  "model_output": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) interpretability, the ability to understand and explain AI decisions, has evolved significantly across different decades, as described in various publications. The conceptual foundations of AI interpretability can be traced back to the Turing Test proposed by Alan Turing in the 1950s [3]. The Turing Test aims to evaluate whether a machine's responses mimic those of a human, thus being considered intelligent. Throughout the years, researchers have recognized that successfully passing the Turing Test signifies an intelligent system [1]. However, the definition and evolution of AI interpretability went beyond just the Turing Test. In the 2000s, papers explored universal intelligence, aiming to understand its relation to human intelligence and other definitions of machine intelligence [4]. They also highlighted the need for AI systems that can reason, test hypotheses, and prepare for future eventualities as a measure of authentic intelligence [1]. The 2010s saw a growing interest in large language models (LLMs) and their potential to demonstrate artificial general intelligence (AGI) [1]. Recent works have emphasized the importance of evaluating these systems, serving as critical tools to identify current limitations and inform the design of more powerful models [1]. The significance of LLMs has also been recognized in academic and industrial domains, particularly in data science and analysis [2]. The past two decades witnessed an evolution from statistical language models to neural language models for language understanding and generation [3]. This advancement in language modeling has contributed to the ongoing development of AI systems with improved interpretability.
