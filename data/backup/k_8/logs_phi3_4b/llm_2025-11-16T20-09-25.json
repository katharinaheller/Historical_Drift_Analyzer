  "prompt_final_to_llm": "You are a comparative analyst. Compare major frameworks or schools of thought, specifying explicit historical information only when stated in the provided snippets. Never infer missing event years. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nCompare and contrast the main theoretical perspectives on discuss how knowledge abstraction differs between symbolic and neural models., grounding historical claims only in explicit snippet content.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] 1301.3781v3.pdf (2013)\n.

  "model_output": "Comparison between Symbolic and Neural Models on Knowledge Abstraction:\n\nSymbolic models, as described in [4], are designed for the storage and retrieval of knowledge, with examples such as MYCIN and EURISKO. They represent knowledge in a network structure where connectionist expert systems based on artificial neural networks can perform classification tasks ([4]). However, they may not be efficient in handling large data sets due to computational complexity (insufficient evidence). Neural models, on the other hand, learn distributed representations of words from large data sets ([1]), aiming for significant improvements over traditional methods like Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) in preserving linear regularities among words. Unlike symbolic models, neural networks utilize big activity vectors, weight matrices, and scalar non-linearities to perform intuitive inference that underpins effortless commonsense reasoning ([2]). Deep learning techniques in neural models have been used for speech and handwriting recognition for a long time ([2]), with simpler models being explored for efficiency on large data sets ([1]).
