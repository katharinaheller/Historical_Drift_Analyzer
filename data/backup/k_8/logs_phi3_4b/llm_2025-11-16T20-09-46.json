Provide a precise definition, clarify theoretical foundations, and explain how interpretations evolved across time and publications. Use event years ONLY if explicitly stated in the snippets. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nDefine describe how reasoning and perception are integrated in intelligent agents., describe its theoretical foundations, and explain how definitions evolved historically across publications.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)\n.

One such theory is the Sequential Prediction (SP) theory [1], proposed in 2018, which aims to simplify concepts in computing and cognitive science, including AI functions like probabilistic reasoning, unsupervised learning, and best-match information retrieval. The SP theory provides a framework for processing knowledge that integrates these functions [1]. In contrast, Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are designed to perform tasks in statistics and data science using planning, reasoning, reflection, multi-agent collaboration, user interface, and knowledge integration [2]. These agents can also access external sources like databases or knowledge graphs to enhance their reasoning capabilities. Definitions of machine intelligence have evolved over time. The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark for intelligent machines in the 1950s [3], but other definitions and tests have been proposed since then [3]. In AI, there are also two contrasting modes of explaining probabilistic reasoning: qualitative belief propagation and scenario-based reasoning, inspired by empirical studies of human strategies for uncertain reasoning conducted in the 1990s [4].
