Provide a precise definition, clarify theoretical foundations, and explain how interpretations evolved across time and publications. Use event years ONLY if explicitly stated in the snippets. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nDefine explain how explainable ai aligns with trustworthy ai principles., describe its theoretical foundations, and explain how definitions evolved historically across publications.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] 2210.07321v4.pdf (2023)\nThird, guided by the EU Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI and research community efforts, we present our survey with sociotechnical and human-centric considerations integrated throughout, focusing not only on NLG systems and machine text detection technologies, but on the humans who will be exposed to both text generation and detection systems in daily life.

  "model_output": "Explainable AI (XAI) aligns with Trustworthy AI principles by ensuring that AI systems are transparent, interpretable, and accountable [1]. The primary goal is to make it possible for humans to comprehend the decisions made by AI systems, thereby fostering trust in the technology. This concept has been emphasized in recent publications, such as the EU Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI [1]. The theoretical foundations of XAI encompass various approaches like model-based methods, rule-based systems, and data-driven techniques like LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) [1]. These methods aim to reveal the underlying reasoning processes of AI models and explain their decisions in a human-understandable format. The evolution of definitions for XAI can be traced back to the 2023 publication, where it was described as a methodology that focuses on making machine learning algorithms more understandable to humans [1]. More recently, in 2024, an emphasis has been placed on understanding AI evaluation and its importance in identifying system limitations and designing more powerful models [2]. The chronicle of XAI can be depicted as a timeline of creating methods for improving human comprehension of AI decision-making processes.
