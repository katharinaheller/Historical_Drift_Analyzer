Only use numeric markers to refer to the provided document indices.\n\nRefined query:\nWhat is AI?\n\nYou are given the following context snippets from historical AI-related documents. Each snippet is associated with a numeric source id in square brackets. When you answer, cite these sources using their numeric ids, e.g. [1], [2].

Large language models (LLMs) are gaining increasing popularity in both academia and industry, owing to their unprecedented performance in various applications.. As LLMs continue to play a vital role in both research and daily use, their evaluation becomes increasingly critical, not only at the task level, but also at the society level for better understanding of their potential risks.
