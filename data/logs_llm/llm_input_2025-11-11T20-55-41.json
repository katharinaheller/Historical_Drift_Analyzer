Large language models (LLMs) are gaining increasing popularity in both academia and industry, owing to their unprecedented performance in various applications.. As LLMs continue to play a vital role in both research and daily use, their evaluation becomes increasingly critical, not only at the task level, but also at the society level for better understanding of their potential risks.
