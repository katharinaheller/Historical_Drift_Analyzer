Expert systems (ES) are knowledge-based systems that were one of the earlier research fields in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and can be defined as knowledgeintensive software that can perform some tasks normally requiring human expertise..

Abstract—Ever since the Turing Test was proposed in the 1950s, humans have explored the mastering of language intelligence by machine.. Language is essentially a complex, intricate system of human expressions governed by grammatical rules..

A fundamental problem in artificial intelligence is that nobody really knows what intelligence is.. The problem is especially acute when we need to consider artificial systems which are significantly different to humans. In this paper we approach this problem in the following way: We take a number of well known informal definitions of human intelligence that have been given by experts, and extract their essential features. .
