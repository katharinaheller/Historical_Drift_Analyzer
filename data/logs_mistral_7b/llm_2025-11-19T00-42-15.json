Provide a precise definition, clarify theoretical foundations, and explain how interpretations evolved across time and publications. Use event years ONLY if explicitly stated in the snippets.

If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3.

The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nDefine what is artificial intelligence?, describe its theoretical foundations, and explain how definitions evolved historically across publications.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] 0712.3329v1.pdf (2007)\n.

  "model_output": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field aimed at developing machine-based intelligence, mimicking or replicating human cognitive functions such as reasoning and learning [2]. The theoretical foundations of AI are rooted in several domains including computing, mathematics, psychology, and linguistics [1][3]. In the 1950s, the Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark for evaluating machine intelligence by gauging a machine's ability to imitate human-like conversation without disclosing its artificial identity [4]. This test serves as one of the primary historical definitions of AI. The evolution of definitions and interpretations of AI across publications reveals a focus on establishing a broad understanding that applies to arbitrary systems and contexts, rather than just humans [1]. Another emphasis has been on the development of machine-based reasoning capabilities, testing hypotheses, and preparing for future eventualities [2]. Additionally, there is an ongoing interest in comprehending and grasping complex linguistic systems [4].
