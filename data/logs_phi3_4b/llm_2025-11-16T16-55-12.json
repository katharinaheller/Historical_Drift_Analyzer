Provide a precise definition, clarify theoretical foundations, and explain how interpretations evolved across time and publications. Use event years ONLY if explicitly stated in the snippets. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nDefine define universal intelligence as discussed in the corpus., describe its theoretical foundations, and explain how definitions evolved historically across publications.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] 0712.3329v1.pdf (2007)\n.

  "model_output": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, as discussed in [1]. The authors examine the concept of universal intelligence, which is aimed at applying commonly expressed ideas about intelligence to arbitrary systems and contexts, not just humans, as described in [1]. The theoretical foundations of AI are based on well-known theories, definitions, and tests of human intelligence developed by psychologists, with a focus on the essence of intelligence in the broadest possible terms. This approach is outlined in [1]. Additionally, the system presented in [2] is Turing-equivalent, meaning it can model the workings of a universal Turing machine, and offers insights into the nature of 'intelligence'. Regarding the evolution of definitions for AI, the authors of [1] claim that they provide a general survey of definitions and tests of machine intelligence. They note that there are numerous surveys of the Turing Test and its variants, but this section is the first general survey of definitions and tests of machine intelligence to their knowledge. Insufficient evidence exists to trace the historical evolution of AI definitions beyond the scope of these two publications. References:\n[1] 0712.3329v1.pdf (2007)\n[2] 0311031v1.pdf (2018)"
