Never infer missing event years. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nCompare and contrast the main theoretical perspectives on outline the core subfields of ai mentioned in the corpus., grounding historical claims only in explicit snippet content.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] 3641289.pdf (2024)\n.

Turing Test (1950s; described in 2024 PDF [1])\nThe Turing Test is a widely recognized benchmark for assessing intelligence by discerning whether responses are from humans or machines. A machine that passes the Turing Test can be considered as intelligent, according to many AI researchers. 2. Mainstream views on human intelligence (discussed in 2007 PDF [2])\nThe paper discusses a complex intellectual, social, and political history of human intelligence but does not specify any specific perspectives within the mainstream. For a more detailed overview, the reader is referred to \"Handbook of Intelligence\" edited by R. J. Sternberg (Ste00). 3. Binet-Simon Intelligence Test (1905; described in 2007 PDF [2])\nThe Binet-Simon Intelligence Test was created by Alfred Binet and Theodore Simon for the purpose of identifying intellectually gifted children who could benefit from early education. The test results were found to be a good predictor of children's academic performance (Bin11). 4. Artificial Intelligence (AI) (no explicit event year; described in 2024 PDF [1])\nArtificial Intelligence refers to the development of machine-based intelligence, focusing on equipping machines with reasoning capabilities, enabling them to test hypotheses, and preparing for future eventualities. 5. Machine-Generated Text Detection (no explicit event year; described in 2023 PDF [3])\nThe work presents a survey of machine-generated text detection, including previously omitted feature-based work and findings from recent contemporary research. 6. Threat models enabled by machine-generated text (no explicit event year; described in 2023 PDF [3])\nThe paper provides an overview of the threat models that can be enabled by machine-generated text at a critical juncture where NLG models and tools are rapidly improving and proliferating.
