If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3.

The theoretical foundations of universal intelligence are rooted in well-known theories, definitions, and tests of human intelligence given by psychologists [1]. These essential features are then mathematically formalized to create a general measure of intelligence applicable to arbitrary machines [1]. Historically, the evolution of interpretations for universal intelligence can be traced back to the concept of Turing-equivalence, which considers a system capable of modeling the workings of a universal Turing machine [2]. This theory is based on principles of minimum length encoding pioneered by Ray Solomonoff and others [2]. The formal definition of machine intelligence in the broadest reasonable sense is presented as an equation that captures the concept of machine intelligence [1], although it's important to note that the specifics of this formalization are not provided within the given context.
