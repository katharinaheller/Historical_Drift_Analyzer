Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number.

You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nAnalyze the mechanisms, strengths, and limitations of list examples of electronics expert systems cited in the corpus., noting origins only when explicitly stated.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] Expert_Systems.pdf (2016)\n.

Objects, which are psychologically dissimilar, are shown far apart; the distance between them can be analyzed to interpret the underlying dimensions as to why these objects have been judged relative to one another. Finally, card sorting techniques provide means of achieving a more focused or systematic understanding of the classifications and relationships in the expert's domain. . It is easy to implement and involves writing the names of objects, experiences, or rules in the expert's domain o",

Our baseline, the ESIM sequence model from Chen et al., uses a biLSTM to encode the premise and hypothesis, followed by a matrix attention layer, a local inference layer, another biLSTM inference composition layer, and finally a pooling operation before the output layer. Overall, adding ELMo to the ESIM model improves accuracy by an average of 0.7% across five random seeds. . A five member ensemble pushes the overall accuracy to 89.3%, exceeding the previous ensemble best of 88.9%. . Semantic ",
